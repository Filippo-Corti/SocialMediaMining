Coupled with the reductions that I told you about on waste and fraud and all of the other things that are going on in our country because I have to stay with child care, I want to stay with child care ‚Äî but those numbers are small relative to the kind of economic numbers that I‚Äôm talking about, including growth, but growth also headed up by what the plan is that I just, that I just told you about. We‚Äôre going to be taking in trillions of dollars and as much as child care is talked about as being expensive, it‚Äôs relatively speaking not very expensive compared to the kinds of numbers we‚Äôll be taking in. We‚Äôre going to make this into an incredible country that can afford to take care of its people. And then we‚Äôll worry about the rest of the world. Let‚Äôs help other people. But we are going to take care of our country first. This is about America first. It‚Äôs about make America great again. We have to do it because right now we are a failing nation.

They tell us the verifiable scientific fact. Eg.\"This person said this on this date at this place.\" End of discussion. And then we decide how we feel about that. Not the reporters trashing the person's words because they are a different political party. It's wild to me to see CCN and Fox news both call the other the liars about things that are verifiable!!! But the bases don't care to check. That should always have been the reporter's DUTY. But instead y'all have news out there literally lying and presenting different \"truths\". I would lose my mind not knowing what to trust in a country like that. Polarized \"fact\" is wild, so unfortunately it makes sense that people live in the reality their party lives in and votes 50/50 accordingly. Because it becomes nearly impossible to form your opinion when a reporter already made up their mind how to tell the story or convey \"facts\". And honestly it's getting worse. Y'alls realities are drifting apart to the point some people can't even acknowledge facts when presented with them. As an outsider I'm scared for y'all.

Let‚Äôs look at Trump‚Äôs record on the economy vs. Biden/Harris.  Biden/Harris inherited from Trump an economy that was in the toilet.  They started way behind the 8 ball.  In contrast, Trump inherited an economy from Obama that was on the upswing and improving at a greater rate than after Trump took office.  You all give Trump too much credit for a good economy when he did little to make it so.  And now he relies on the fact that while he was president, the economy was in pretty good shape so you people somehow think he will magically improve the economy ‚Äì an economy that is totally different and has many unique and unprecedented challenges.  His explanation of how he will do it lacks credibility.   In fact, during the debate, Trump never explained what he would do, because he knows it is all smoke and mirrors.  Outside of the debate, Trump has claimed he would reduce prices by increasing US oil production.  Just how is he going to get oil producers to ‚Äúdrill baby drill‚Äù and what will that actually get us?  He has not explained just why oil producers would increase oil production beyond a level for which there is a demand. They won't, because it is not in their economic interests to supply more oil than they can sell or produce a supply of oil at a level that would reduce their profits. When supply goes up and demand stays the same, prices decrease and so do profits. That's the way capitalism works.   It only makes sense for oil producers to produce more oil if demand goes up.  And demand for oil is not going to increase.  By and large, people and businesses are buying what they need.  Furthermore, during the debate, Trump admitted that US oil production is actually higher now than when he left office.  So why hasn‚Äôt that increase had the economic effect he claims he can produce by increasing oil production?  And even if increased oil production over current levels would reduce the cost of gas, why should grocery stores and other retailers pass that savings on to consumers instead of banking the savings to increase their profits?  What else is Trump going to do to reduce prices for the goods we consume?  He claims reducing regulations will reduce prices.  But the story is the same on this lie.  Those who produce consumer goods will not pass any reduced costs realized by deregulation on to consumers.  It‚Äôs not in their economic interests to do that.  Trump also wants to put tariffs on all imports, but economists universally agree this will increase prices for consumers.  And, if you think the price of groceries is high now, wait to see what happens after Trump deports all the people who are cheaply growing and harvesting your vegetables, picking your fruit, milking the cows, tending to the cattle, gathering your eggs, etc.  Harris has been clear on what she would like to do and did so again in this interview.  Furthermore, the economy is improving.  Trump‚Äôs policies will make things worse if he implements them.  If he is elected and does nothing, he can again take credit for an improving economy he had nothing to do with improving.", "date": "2024-10-01T02:31:12Z", "like_count": 13}, {"id": "UgxUekptW4deiymhzD54AaABAg.A913uaacyA2A91fl7AZ5H_", "author_id": "UCrR2BYQMY5ZEBmLWzSiN3rA", "author_name": "@jayb6291", "content": "Memba", "date": "2024-10-01T02:42:33Z", "like_count": 7}, {"id": "UgxUekptW4deiymhzD54AaABAg.A913uaacyA2A91gzrHFvp2", "author_id": "UCdq_hqCXpbjMyPUtkArNIGg", "author_name": "@shotbysteve2853", "content": "üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ", "date": "2024-10-01T02:53:18Z", "like_count": 2}, {"id": "UgxUekptW4deiymhzD54AaABAg.A913uaacyA2A91hLjZCa5N", "author_id": "UCD4gcxbru7PD_W7lMD9niVw", "author_name": "@andrewcastro4450", "content": "@@Decision333 I love each and everyone of you in the comments lol üí™üèΩ ‚ù§Ô∏è", "date": "2024-10-01T02:56:25Z", "like_count": 4}, {"id": "UgxUekptW4deiymhzD54AaABAg.A913uaacyA2A91i5heVdE2", "author_id": "UCiT5XhUk9ujHgdkr8VqywSA", "author_name": "@homemadechecks3909", "content": "Lmao", "date": "2024-10-01T03:02:58Z", "like_count": 4}, {"id": "UgxUekptW4deiymhzD54AaABAg.A913uaacyA2A91iF3XJGSo", "author_id": "UCiT5XhUk9ujHgdkr8VqywSA", "author_name": "@homemadechecks3909", "content": "Best comment üòÇ", "date": "2024-10-01T03:04:14Z", "like_count": 3}, {"id": "UgxUekptW4deiymhzD54AaABAg.A913uaacyA2A91jgYvY4_f", "author_id": "UCoHdswIrLkXL26e3cUCoOUA", "author_name": "@houseofyashya8909", "content": "@@thebible360this is what I was comin to say üò≠", "date": "2024-10-01T03:16:52Z", "like_count": 0}, {"id": "UgxUekptW4deiymhzD54AaABAg.A913uaacyA2A91mB1jFBb2", "author_id": "UCZPdnLvgDfYxhsT6KuOiOmg", "author_name": "@MannyChilds", "content": "Y'all falling for Kamala and this interview! üò™", "date": "2024-10-01T03:38:39Z", "like_count": 2}, {"id": "UgxUekptW4deiymhzD54AaABAg.A913uaacyA2A91t5gVuwBA", "author_id": "UCTEOYEozFxoNTi0UNPf0I9g", "author_name": "@kingk7613", "content": "‚Äã@marlenehicks6070 Her policies are that she grew up in a middle class neighborhood & her neighbors all had nice lawns & not only does she seasons her Collard Greens with bacon but she also washes them in the tub üòâ", "date": "2024-10-01T04:39:05Z", "like_count": 6}, {"id": "UgxUekptW4deiymhzD54AaABAg.A913uaacyA2A91uYbA5-Gh", "author_id": "UCS5SsjJNI02bmzAi5440xmQ", "author_name": "@htorres236", "content": "I read that comment in two Kamala accents", "date": "2024-10-01T04:51:46Z", "like_count": 5}, {"id": "UgxUekptW4deiymhzD54AaABAg.A913uaacyA2A91vK5AJ_p1", "author_id": "UCC2lqSWNiw-9UmGCdMkEk6Q", "author_name": "@bananabagel2", "content": "@@thebible360haha I said it just like this üòÇüòÇ", "date": "2024-10-01T04:58:32Z", "like_count": 0}, {"id": "UgxUekptW4deiymhzD54AaABAg.A913uaacyA2A91ySClH2_s", "author_id": "UCaiZERdqTPq_hJdCE8o8jnA", "author_name": "@IAmAlmightyGod", "content": "‚Äã@@thebible360You mean \" you Betta Thaaink ah union worker\"!", "date": "2024-10-01T05:25:51Z", "like_count": 1}, {"id": "UgxUekptW4deiymhzD54AaABAg.A913uaacyA2A920YpqU_oV", "author_id": "UC4jhYlIOWDBnh_2jhG3q3fg", "author_name": "@robbycook4298", "content": "Funny that the Union workers support Trump, not Harris", "date": "2024-10-01T05:52:58Z", "like_count": 0}, {"id": "UgxUekptW4deiymhzD54AaABAg.A913uaacyA2A922ywm7PlN", "author_id": "UCiBFA9XHpPIrn75XqKvymFg", "author_name": "@dinomunroe3675", "content": "@@patriciagallagher6986 https://kamalaharris.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Policy_Book_Economic-Opportunity.pdf", "date": "2024-10-01T06:14:09Z", "like_count": 0}, {"id": "UgxUekptW4deiymhzD54AaABAg.A913uaacyA2A923WIytP-l", "author_id": "UC6WPT4h4uBzgoISXv3z5Tlg", "author_name": "@Smiley869", "content": "@@thebible360how about in a Latin accent??", "date": "2024-10-01T06:18:50Z", "like_count": 2}, {"id": "UgxUekptW4deiymhzD54AaABAg.A913uaacyA2A927h5v-CQl", "author_id": "UCJJcGktnmf8MrwxQLT3ufkg", "author_name": "@marcusmorris4833", "content": "‚Äã@@oldschoolnews2042üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ", "date": "2024-10-01T06:55:24Z", "like_count": 0}, {"id": "UgxUekptW4deiymhzD54AaABAg.A913uaacyA2A92ATbT_tuX", "author_id": "UChH4Juk5toIJlRD1D8bD9ng", "author_name": "@charlesdotson4766", "content": "@@patriciagallagher6986 ARE YOU LISTENING??

They accuse him of being racist, but they never mention the black people he helped with their start-up companies. Nor, do they mention that he helped with HBCUs. Celebrities like Oprah and Whoopi loved him, but they, like many others, turned on him. Perhaps it's because he left the Democratic party and became a Republican. Donald Trump is a leader. He went to the border. He visited the Goldstar Families. He surveyed some of the damage from Hurricane Helene (He also donated). Where was Kamala? Where was Biden? He did those things because he loves America, and he wants us to be okay. He wants us to be self-reliant and prosperous as a country. He goes into hostile interviews knowing what he will have to face. He went into a rigged debate knowing that one of the executives, Dana Walden, was Kamala's friend. We won't even talk about her sorority sister, Linsey Davis, being one of the moderators. Kamala will only interview in friendly territory where she gets softball interviews.

I hate Trump, but I'll watch his interviews in full, because I like to be informed. You should try to do the same. Trump could NEVER speak about mental health the way she does here. And he literally has no clear policies at all! Of course, he plans to drill for more oil, environment be damned; place tarrifs on everything (which will raise prices of all of it for YOU- not the importing countries; he'll close the border, instead of fixing immigration; and he'll crater the economy by deporting people, including those who came here legally, like the Hatianss who are here legally and were coming in during his administration. He has no policies for lowering prices on anything and only concepts of a plan on Healthcare. Maybe Harris repeats herself, but her policy goals are clear: building more homes by cutting red tape and incentivizing builders to add more supply (which will bring down the cost of housing), down-payment assistance for first- time homebuyers (a similar plan under Obama gave people like my sister 8k toward a home, her plan is 25k), 6k child tax credit for new presents; increase child tax credits for families with children to help with childcare (which the GOP recently voted against-- family values?); money for small businesses, lower more prescription costs for everyone. It's all laid out on her website. Personally, I'd say stop just assuming,  and actually listen. Also, try reading.

The point she is making IN CONTEXT, which is how it has to be understood, is related to he child tax credit. She's saying that it benefits the entire community when we strengthen the ability of parents to raise children better, which is often related to resources. In other words, as she said immediately after that, \"it benefits all of us\". \n\nShe's entirely correct. We could radically reduce our need to spend money on prisons & law enforcement interdiction if we confront issues early on that help to create the conditions that make the need for that in the first. This is coming from somebody who oversaw the largest state judicial system in the United States & actively developed programs to do what she is talking about.\n\nIn America, politicians want you to believe that when they spend money on corporations it's an \"investment\", but when we do the same from the bottom of the economic pyramid instead of the top, it's \"socialism\". This is why Trump was able to hand his Wall Street buddies a trillion dollar tax cut on the backs of the poor & the middle class.

This is a binary choice.  Besides, I'm not voting with emotion.  Here's why I'm voting for Harris/Walz.  Trump is a charlatan.  He's got some people fooled.  Build a wall - he didn't.  Better, cheaper health plan - never had one, only concepts.  Claimed he had an infrastructure plan - never had one.  Raised taxes by eliminating the state and local tax deduction and limiting the mortgage interest rate deduction.  Biden/Harris, on the other hand, did the following:  1) Developed and implemented a nationwide plan to distribute vaccine and get shots in arms (Trump had no distribution plan when he left office, but he should have had one in case he was elected to a second term); 2) Brought our economy out of the hole caused by the pandemic and Trump's handling of it by getting creating and getting the American Rescue Plan passed in Congress.  Among other things, that legislation put money in people's pockets, increased the child tax credit and thereby reduced child poverty to an historical low, saved small businesses, backfilled budget shortfalls in local governments to keep local services running, including keeping and putting more cops on the streets, and more (See https://independentsector.org/resource/summary-of-the-american-rescue-plan-act-of-2021/?gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjw_4S3BhAAEiwA_64YhujgcZ5cSj6-CkfKAjWcvn6PQX7oOYEAufYgGDjfsWlrojoenghJhRoCFssQAvD_BwE  ); 3) Created and got the Chips and Science Act passed in Congress to incentivize manufacturing of computer chips in the USA instead of having to rely on Taiwan; 4) Created and got the infrastructure bill passed in Congress as part of the Inflation Reduction Act - now infrastructure projects are up and going all over the country, something that Trump said he would do when he was president, but didn't do even though he had 4 years to do it; 5) Reduced the cost of insulin for seniors; 6) Passed the Inflation Reduction Act, which included the infrastructure funding and among other things also, gave the president authority to negotiate lower prices for prescription medication for Medicare, created and implemented environmental reforms designed to address global warming and develop a clean-energy economy - something our grandchildren and their children and their grandchildren will be thankful for in the future, brought broadband to rural and underserved communities, and more; and 6) Negotiated a bipartisan immigration bill that Trump killed purely for political reasons. In Harris's first term, she can move onto the things she now proposes if the House and Senate cooperate, including immigration reform.  As for the economy, it cannot and could not be repaired overnight as Trump would have you believe. The fact of the matter is that under Biden/Harris, the rate of inflation has declined significantly and continues to decline.  As a result, the Federal Reserve Board recently began decreasing interest rates.  In addition the creation of jobs continues to increase, unemployment is lower and the stock market is higher than during the pre-pandemic Trump era.  And by the way, Trump inherited an economy from Obama that was improving at a greater rate than after Trump took office. The Biden/Harris administration inherited an economy from Trump that was in the toilet, not all of which was Trump's fault. For example, inflation is a worldwide phenomenon stemming from the pandemic, but under Biden/Harris, the USA has handled inflation far better than any other developed country.  No emotion - just facts.  As for getting nothing out of it, aside from Black unemployment being at its lowest, Harris will continue to nominate federal judges from diverse backgrounds.  Trump didn't in his first term and he will continue his Federalist plan to make it a whiter judiciary in his second term.  Trump also wants to bring back stop and frisk.  And he wants to give police complete immunity for anything they do to people.  Instead of ignoring things Black people \"get out of it,\" it might be better to do some research and then ask yourself what have you got to lose by giving Trump another term.", "date": "2024-10-01T05:54:25Z", "like_count": 0}, {"id": "UgyNOdH_QhTlHoFrwcl4AaABAg.A91HMGyGV1gA923BONgDKB", "author_id": "UC-zAuP4bhBMxfBDTkH1F9Eg", "author_name": "@mary-l9t", "content": "@@williammurray7268all the fucking time.

And as Bloomberg Opinion contributor Claudia Sahm has pointed out, household debt burdens are near historic lows.\n - Preliminary data suggest that inequality continued to narrow in 2023.

But I can't take MAGA's criticisms seriously because they have every excuse in the world or any ridiculous conspiracy theory they can come up with so that nothing is ever Trump's fault. He is perfect and anything negative was a coordinated effort, a witch hunt, the deep state, etc.. üôÑHe never does anything wrong, he only has wrong done to him. It is insane. And just so we are all clear. About .005% of the things that both sides are promising might have a slight chance of happening. There is a coordinated effort by both parties to block any bill, unless it benefits the donors that bribe both parties. The political climate is one that nothing gets done, they cause chaos among the electorate, so that while we are yelling and screaming at each other, all of them and their rich donors are robbing us all blind. Any bill that benefits the wealthy and corporations gets serious consideration and most likely gets passed. Pay attention, anytime a bill that would benefit regular people is proposed, they immediately start the questions.. \"How will you pay for that?\", \"What about the deficit?\", \"Is that really necessary?\". But when it is tax cuts that 80%+ benefits the top 1% and will add trillions to the debt? That will pass with flying colors. It is not Democrat  vs Republican voters, it is ALL OF US versus the political and corporate/financial elite.
