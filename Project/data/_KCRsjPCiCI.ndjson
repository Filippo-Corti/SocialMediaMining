God bless you and have a wonderful day. https://youtube.com/shorts/rMkj6-_F3hk?si=_eVYu2uPxiyMmSNC", "date": "2024-10-25T22:18:40Z", "like_count": 0}, {"id": "Ugy-J1J2iHN7puar8F54AaABAg.A9Ig5ZXyMpJAA4G8-YFXg1", "author_id": "UCz5uxBxnwozEIa7uE9ui46w", "author_name": "@ElizabethMBoyd", "content": "And to make one look at the views just over half a million in 2 weeks meanwhile Joe rogan interview  is over 20 million views in 21hrs", "date": "2024-10-26T23:18:59Z", "like_count": 0}, {"id": "Ugy-J1J2iHN7puar8F54AaABAg.A9Ig5ZXyMpJAA5DD8YcZSJ", "author_id": "UCKepTAGj12s6_rpr0FKYCbQ", "author_name": "@weid1888", "content": "üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è", "date": "2024-10-27T08:12:43Z", "like_count": 0}, {"id": "Ugy-J1J2iHN7puar8F54AaABAg.A9Ig5ZXyMpJAA5rc7FMZO_", "author_id": "UCDgl74NajWvYEqkCKSF8jug", "author_name": "@lisaz45", "content": "I did.

Trump won every battleground state that's been called so far. We're still waiting on Nevada, but he's beating her by roughly 6 points and about 186,000 votes. With the current outstanding ballots totals, she'd need to win roughly 70.2 percent of all outstanding votes to beat Trump in Nevada. Considering that a majority of those outstanding votes are coming from Maricopa County in which Trump is leading by 5 percent, it is all but impossible for Kamala to even win Nevada. The most likely scenario is that Trump will win all the battleground states this years.\n\nEven if you're hoping she'll win the popular vote, which she's currently losing by roughly 3,687,000 points, that would  require her to win 71.1 of all outstanding votes. Even in California, where the bulk of uncounted votes currently are, she's only beating Trump by 58  to 39. Again, it's all but impossible for her to win the popular vote. The most likely scenario is that Trump will beat her in the popular vote by about 2.2 million.\n\nIn the end, Harris lost the Electoral College by a massive margin, lost all the swing states, and will likely lose the popular vote by millions of votes.\n\nIn short, you may need to flush the sand out of your m-a-n-gina.", "date": "2024-11-10T01:56:08Z", "like_count": 0}, {"id": "Ugy-J1J2iHN7puar8F54AaABAg.A9Ig5ZXyMpJAAdaW9dnYv9", "author_id": "UCVLjIKtwLBgAgkUgzPedXMA", "author_name": "@NotThereJustGone", "content": "@udhav423¬† You took this election far too seriously, yet you're still wildly ignorant about basic political calculations.

You could make the argument that a fetus is a life and I don‚Äôt think the left has much to refute that. And if someone intentionally ends that life, it‚Äôs not unreasonable to regard that as murder. What doesn‚Äôt make much logical sense to me is: \n\n1) not wanting to prosecute the person responsible for that murder \n\n2) wanting individual states to decide whether that murder is legal or not. \n\nAt least Democrats are logically consistent. They believe reproductive rights are human rights. They don‚Äôt want some states to be able to deny these rights while other states protect them. That doesn‚Äôt make sense. If you are okay with your neighboring state legalizing abortion, then why not your neighboring city, county, district, borough, suburb, etc.? If you‚Äôre okay with abortions just across the state border, why not down the street? If you live in a border town, this is literally the case. I do not get this position. And this is the position of Donald Trump and the Republican Party. So either they are lying about believing abortion is murder, or they are lying about wanting a national abortion ban. Personally, my money is on both. Most Republican politicians don‚Äôt really care about abortion, they will take whatever position will keep them in power. Herschel Walker is a prime example, a man who is ostensibly staunchly pro-life who has literally paid for an abortion in his past. I would be surprised if Trump himself has never paid for an abortion. Well, he is pretty cheap, so I suppose it‚Äôs conceivable‚Ä¶ \n\nAs long as a national abortion ban remains unpopular nationwide, Republicans will remain tight-lipped on the subject. But I can easily imagine a scenario where pressure from the Republican base forces their hand and they do indeed pass one. I mean, if every Republican opposed to a national abortion ban is primaried from the right, there is no doubt in my mind that enough will flip and a ban would conceivably squeak through Congress, assuming Republicans control both chambers. \n\nSo, although it is fair to accuse Democrats of mischaracterizing Donald Trump‚Äôs current position on abortion since he definitively claimed he does not support a national abortion ban (though he would not commit to vetoing one), it is also fair for Democrats to fearmonger that Republicans may pass a national abortion ban if given control of both chambers of Congress and the Presidency (Republican Senator Lindsey Graham introduced one in the Senate not too long after Roe v. Wade was overturned). Both arguments hold water. Republicans would ban abortion if given the chance, that‚Äôs what their constituents elected them for. Trump won‚Äôt push for the national ban, but I doubt he won‚Äôt cave to pressure if the bill came to his desk. He has bent to pressure time and time again. He initially argued for gun restrictions after the Parkland Shooting, but the NRA shut him up. He initially argued a 6-week abortion ban was too extreme before announcing (the very next day!) he‚Äôd vote to uphold it in Florida. He initially sided with Vladimir Putin over his own intelligence community at the Helsinki Summit, before backtracking and claiming he misspoke. He has no principles, no convictions, no spine. \n\nRepublicans are just biding their time until the Overton window shifts in their favor. They won‚Äôt ban abortion if they fear political backlash from independents and moderates. However, they also fear political backlash from their base, so they are caught between a rock and a hard place. The reality is there is no guarantee which way the political winds will shift, so if anyone opposes an abortion ban, voting Democratic is the only safe choice. If you support an abortion ban, voting Republican is the logical choice, though it is no guarantee. Republicans will use the filibuster to argue they can‚Äôt pass an abortion ban without 60 votes in the Senate, which is misleading because they can remove the filibuster with a simple majority of 51 (or 50 plus the Vice President). They want to have their cake and to eat it too. They want to pretend they are against abortion, but not have to codify that position into law. Democrats put their money where their mouths are and actually tried to codify Roe v. Wade into law. They were unsuccessful, as they could not remove the filibuster (both Senators Manchin (WV) and Sinema (AZ) opposed such a move), and then they subsequently lost the House in the 2022 mid-terms. However, they showed they were willing to fulfill their promise to voters given the opportunity. If Democrats are given another trifecta (the Presidency and majorities in both chambers of Congress), protection for reproductive rights will be a foregone conclusion. If Republicans are given the same (trifecta), a national abortion ban is possible but not guaranteed.", "date": "2024-10-08T04:02:19Z", "like_count": 4}, {"id": "UgyZeQtiQY2K7YeWwkV4AaABAg.A9J5E4s8NqeA9JqoqKD4WC", "author_id": "UCZ_ctYfm46HCNdjY3ta53wg", "author_name": "@fayn1174", "content": "I didn‚Äôt understand the importance of states having the power until the vaccines.", "date": "2024-10-08T04:05:30Z", "like_count": 2}, {"id": "UgyZeQtiQY2K7YeWwkV4AaABAg.A9J5E4s8NqeA9JrI2wp_8M", "author_id": "UC0LK7rGCPbzvRk8ayHS3Hyw", "author_name": "@RJForest.", "content": "@@AntoineLavoisier-y3e abortion shouldn't be banned, but it should be monitored.

If getting vaccinated only prevented or reduced the risk of hospitalization and death, then I would agree that ‚ÄúMy Body, My Choice‚Äù applies because there would not be the ‚Äúharm to others‚Äù factor. It is analogous to requiring seatbelts and helmets. These measures really only protect the person implementing them. So why do we have laws requiring them? Why not allow personal choice? Well, some states do, but other states see the benefit in reducing casualties, injuries, and fatalities at the expense of personal freedom. \n\nI mean why not legalize drunk driving as well. ‚ÄúMy Body, My Choice,‚Äù right? People drive drunk without injuring anyone all the time. Again, it‚Äôs the ‚Äúpotential for harm.‚Äù I agree that unintentionally infecting someone with a deadly virus is not the same as murdering them, but I also agree that assessing risks and enacting laws and policies to reduce said risk is completely within the purview of government. A drunk driver certainly didn‚Äôt intend on crashing. Sometimes indirect consequences are important factors to weigh as well. \n\nAs with injuries and fatalities in vehicle accidents, serious cases of Covid infections fill hospital beds and tie up resources, including, but not limited to, first responders, paramedics, doctors, nurses, ambulances, medical equipment, etc. This will indirectly affect/harm others who did not make the personal choice of refusing a seatbelt, helmet, vaccine, sobriety, etc. What happens when one of these people suffer a medical emergency and show up at a hospital at capacity, say filled with unvaccinated Covid patients, and gets turned away? (This has literally happened). Oh well? \n\nI agree there is a line where personal freedom should prevail, but where that line is drawn is open for debate. I believe in freedom, but not absolute freedom, devoid of all rules and responsibilities. \n\nAnd yes, with abortion, the ‚Äúintent‚Äù is to kill or terminate the pregnancy. So I agree that if the fetus is unquestionably and undeniably a human person, ‚ÄúMy Body, My Choice‚Äù should not apply. Therein lies the rub. Not everyone agrees on the status of the fetus. The distinction may be as clear as day to you, but I don‚Äôt even think the field of science has definitively defined what constitutes ‚Äúlife.‚Äù There is currently a debate on whether a virus can technically be considered ‚Äúlife.‚Äù It has its own DNA, but does not have cells.

As I understand it, Canada had far more sweeping vaccine mandates. And the convoys were Canadians I thought, not Americans. But we did have anti-vax protests in the US as well, so I suppose your point is the same either way.

Maybe I used it once for a flight? I definitely never showed it to enter any store. I honestly think people were overreacting, but that‚Äôs just my opinion.

Of course, I believe vaccines are generally safe and effective, so I wasn‚Äôt so bent out of shape about getting one. \n\nBut what a lot of commenters are glossing over is the fact that Kamala Harris is not responsible for private corporations (like stores, theaters, restaurants, or gyms) having vaccine mandates, nor is she responsible for any state, city, or local vaccine mandates. Even the mandates tied to the federal government (military, federal agencies, etc.) are not really Kamala Harris‚Äôs doing. As Vice President, she has almost no authority whatsoever. It‚Äôs fair to blame Biden for the federal mandates.

I personally know of such people, so it‚Äôs not just me being ‚Äúbrainwashed by the media.‚Äù \n\nAlso, I never promoted ‚Äúforced medication‚Äù or forced vaccinations. I simply stated that vaccines save lives, which is a fact. \n\nEven though it is inconclusive and unknown which cases of myocarditis were directly attributable to the vaccine because myocarditis occurrence amongst the general population varies with time and geographic location, I will concede the potential link between myocarditis and the Covid-19 vaccine. \n\nAccording to the National Institute of Health, the fatality rate from post-vaccine myocarditis is 1 in 5,000,000 doses. I‚Äôm not going to pretend that‚Äôs not significant because it is. When you are talking about hundreds of millions of doses administered, that translates to dozens of potential deaths. But there are risks with all vaccines just as there are risks with all medications. Statistically, you are much more likely to die of a Covid-19 infection than a Covid-19 vaccine. That‚Äôs just a fact. From the National Institute of Health: ‚ÄúIn all age groups studied, the overall risks of SARS‚ÄêCoV‚Äê2 infection‚Äêrelated hospitalization and death are hugely greater than the risks from post‚Äêvaccine myocarditis.‚Äù \n\nAnd another fact to consider, infection from SARS-CoV-2 itself can cause myocarditis. According to the NIH, ‚ÄúIt was shown by the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that infection with SARS‚ÄêCoV‚Äê2 increases the risk of myocarditis by 16‚Äêfold from 9 cases per 100‚Äâ000 to 150 cases per 100‚Äâ000.‚Äù \n\nIn other words, the benefits of getting vaccinated far outweigh the risks. Driving a car is a risk. Drinking water from the tap is a risk. They are risks I take either out of convenience, or simply because the alternative is worse. \n\nSay you were driving on the freeway and your vehicle caught on fire. Your options are to remain in the vehicle and potentially be engulfed in flames or pull over and get out and potentially be hit by a vehicle driving by. In this scenario, the Covid-19 virus is the fire and escaping the vehicle is getting vaccinated. Neither option is guaranteed to keep you alive, but one gives you a better chance. That‚Äôs not a perfect analogy, so I‚Äôm sure you will tear it to shreds as not applicable, but hopefully you get the point I am trying to convey about calculated risk. \n\nI‚Äôm not suggesting anyone be strapped to a chair and vaccinated against their will. But neither do I consider a vaccine mandate a ‚Äúcrime against humanity.‚Äù The Holocaust was a crime against humanity.

Groceries cost you e.g. 30% of your income. If your income was 3K that was 1K for groceries.

The courts in Austin fucked up they gave full custody to the step mom, she didnt adopt him but she got full custody of her stepson that she isnt even biologically related to because the courts are slanted towards women.

Still how does a step parent get full custody of a child they never adopted?  In cases where the roles are reversed, you as a man if you have a step child but never adopt them, if the marriage goes south and you divorce you have zero legal right to said child.

Abortion bans are unlikely to help this issue and might even worsen it, just practically speaking.  Whether you like it or not, for various reasons the states who passed these bans have had a certain number of ob gyns leave or stop offering any services pertaining to pregnancy care at all due to a fear of being prosecuted for non-abortion care that may be mistaken for abortion. For example removing the contents of a womb where the fetus has died already to prevent hemorrhage and infection. I think everyone agrees that isn't an abortion but doctors are afraid that dumb judges will think it's an abortion.  Without doctors to take care of pregnant women our miscarriage and still birth rates go up.  People might get back alley abortions that make them infertile.

He was literally called racist for 15+ years and even now for saying it was a problem, and that it would bring crime. It did, and now Biden and Harris are being harangued for causing it to happen\n\n3. Putting Tariffs on China.

Meanwhile Biden federally spends like a psychopath. Federal spending makes up 41.6% of the cause of inflation since 2021. He is directly to blame for the inflation of energy, groceries, housing, etc.\n\n4. Hunter Biden laptop. Was outright denounced as Russian disinformation by every left-leaning news media outlet.

But it's up to you to prove your claims. So can you? Where are you getting your information?\n\nNone of the states you mentioned have lowered the marriage age. All of them require children under that age (generally 17 - 21) to have parental consent to marry--ALL of them. That is a \"restriction.\" It is absolutely not the case that random adults can just run off with children and marry them, as you've said. (I'd also point out that even with parental permission, they'd still have to find someone willing to grant the license and perform the ceremony, which is probably not easy to do when it comes to actual children.) San Francisco removed or lessened penalties for adults who have \"relationships\" with younger people; it used to be it was legal if both parties were within a few years of age of each other, and now the number of years allowed is wider. That's what I was thinking of when I mentioned California. (And BTW, Oklahoma's legislature is currently working to end the \"child marriage loophole\" in that state.)\n\nAs for my mentioning not having time to do an exhaustive search, I was simply describing the situation in my own state of Texas but saying I don't know if every state with abortion bans is the same. You keep insisting that victims who are impregnated by their assailant have to carry those babies to term here because of our abortion law, so I pointed out that in fact Plan B is still available here, so a woman who is assaulted can take it if that is a concern for her. I also pointed out that birth control pills are available here OTC, without a prescription, which means it's even easier for all women to access them and thus prevent unintended pregnancy. It's not like TX is forcing women to get and remain pregnant or \"banning birth control,\" as some people claim Republicans are trying to do. Our red state allows the sale of OTC birth control pills and Plan B.\n\nSo again, please tell me your source(s) for the info you posted above, because I have not found anything to corroborate it.

When pregant people are discussing their fetus they speak in the future tense, we are \"having\" a baby, we are \"having\" a boy, we are \"having\" a girl, etc. They don't say we \"have\" a baby and here it is do you want to hold it? That's nonsense. Perhaps in the last trimester we have the borderline case that it is ready to be delivered and so for all practical cases we can now speak of it as an actual baby but that doesn't negate the prior cases going all the way back to conception.\n3. To be a kid is to have a specific birthday. What age is a zygote, what age is a blastocyst, what age is a embryo, etc? It is nonsense to speak of age of something that hasn't been born yet.\n4. Kids have the capacity to learn. What can a zygote learn? What can a blastocyst learn? etc? Can it learn its abc's in order to talk to you? Hell it can't even breath like us. Again pure nonsense talk.\n5. Kids are capable of being abused and thus other persons capable of calling cps on a woman or man abusing their kid. Are you going to call cps on a pregnant woman smoking a ciggarrette or drinking alcohol or rock climbing since she is endangering her kid?\n6. Kids are counted as person when driving in the hov lane on the highway systems. Yet we don't count pregnant woman as two people. Thus fetuses are not legal persons.\n\nMen have the same rights as woman and vice versa. If men don't want to be parents they don't have to be. And the same should be true of woman. In cases of conflict all we need do is as a society agree on the default policy, do we assume people want to have kids when they engage in sex, or do we assume they do not want to have kids when they engage in sex. As long as people are consistent with this policy no conflict need arise. Of course, you will always have law breakers but we deal with law breakers as we do with any law breaker. There are all sorts of default policies that we have adopted into our systems of government, default age of consent, default age to buy cigarettes and alcohol, default age capable of getting a drivers license, default presumption of innocents before a court of law, default responsibilities of caretakers, etc etc.", "date": "2024-10-07T21:33:33Z", "like_count": 3}, {"id": "Ugy8XiZd_2V2Iz7tlbd4AaABAg.A9IklNqYsHgA9J9MQdgZWh", "author_id": "UC7m2QJynpFwwC_H15NU2o_A", "author_name": "@Demondcooks", "content": "@@gabrielduran291 you just said LIFE, liberty and pursuit of happiness, but talking about terminating a LIFE!
