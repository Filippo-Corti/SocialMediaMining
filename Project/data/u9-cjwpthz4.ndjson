Also, if she went on a Joe Rogan or some Fox show and gave good solid answers to their toughest questions, that would get her message in front of an audience who isn't likely to hear it otherwise.  Lastly, I am voting for Harris/Walz and I loved her in the debate, but I can't deny that I have heard her say a number of the policy related things and anecdotes that she shared in this interview before almost verbatim; it definitely felt more scripted and less off-the-cuff than a regular autocomplete interview.  She might come off a little more authentically and not so rehearsed in a less accommodating interview.  If she did it successfully, it could have a big impact.

The Bible instructs people to \"Honor your father and your mother\" in Exodus 20:12 And if your mother has passed, I am truly sorry for your loss. My father has passed and my Mother had to teach me to do a lot of things. I'm not saying that 1 Timothy 2:12 should be ignored. Nothing in the Old and New Testaments should be ignored. But I just always thought of my Mother as a great teacher. My Mom taught pre-schoolers. I believe that God is happy when people learn new things because He taught us. Even Mary taught the Disciples things about her Son. I think anyone can teach anything they are good at. My nephews taught me to play Minecraft. My niece shows me how to put Lego sets together. My brother taught me how to throw a baseball. God gives people different abilities. For example, God's Plan was such that I am unable to walk.
