The energy point, stating it the way he did insinuates that our energy situation is terrible, when in fact currently we are the energy capital of the world & are producing more oil than any other country in the world. Interestingly enough, we've been the top producer for 6 years.  Who was the President 6 years ago? Why won't he take the win? Because if he did, then he'd have to admit that energy production has gone up even more since he left. Surprisingly, lol, he's a champion of Obamacare & made it more affordable for enrollees. Why won't he take the win? And go on the debate stage to say he has 'concepts of a plan?' Because he'd have to admit to how he tried to undermind it, the flip flopping he did on the subject & would have to admit Obamacare has good bones to it. He has some wins--but won't run on them. Playing to the base is more important. Yes, inflation was up for a long time but is now down to pre-pandemic levels at 2.5% and it will take some time for it to become visible in our everyday life. Most who know a bit about economics knew inflation would come. That ""free"" money from the pandemic times isn't so free after all.
