When the economy is doing well and prices are low people have more money to spend on \"wants\" instead of \"needs\". The economy was booming while Trump was in office, prices were very low, which means people had more money to put into things like crypto, which is what drove the price up. Trumps policies very much so had a role to play in the boom of crypto bc people had more spending money to invest with. My bank account looked infinitely better while he was in office than it has over the past 4 years. I'm not sure why people are in such denial to this when it isn't an opinion but rather an objective fact. The indoctrination is strong with some people.

She has given in-depth answers to tough questions. IMO, much more in-depth than Trump, and you can read all of her policies on her website. Maybe you have not watched full interviews with her? Try the Howard Stern interview? \n\nPersonally, I feel like USA has amnesia and has forgotten what a shit-show things were under Trump. Maybe some people made money in the first couple years because the stock market was blowing up, and interest rates were low, but the whole world suffered inflation during and after the pandemic, not just the USA. BTW, the Fed Reserve makes monetary policy decisions independently of the president, so you can't blame that on Biden--you can blame that on world wide inflation. We have actually come through the pandemic much stronger than most nations did, even if we got into some debt to keep our economy running. Anyway, recovering from that, and tackling debt is a real issue that I would hope politicians would be focused on. But Trump has given us no plan to do this. \n\nWhile Trump was president, a lot of crooks were making big money off of us via Trump gifting contracts to his buddies and things were a complete mess during the pandemic. He was a bully who made intentionally made it hard for people suffering from natural disasters, attempting to use FEMA money as a political bargaining chip with people who lost everything in the fires out West, he imprisoned immigrants in for-profit prisons at tax-payer expense. \n\nHis immigration policy was to gift private prison contracts to people who gave money to him. Imprisoning people on US soil was costing us $140/day per person. I mean, people can run hotels and make a profit for $140/day so putting people in chain link cages at the border should not cost that. It was a way for a few people to make buttloads of money overcharging taxpayers and it is immmoral.  How about all those government contracts for the \"wall\" that never got built and was easy to penetrate. He is as corrupt as any president we have ever had. That is just one example of thousands. Selling off government lands to people who give him kickbacks? Pay attention to why this guy wants to be president. He wants to be president because he is deep in debt and trying to stay out of prison.\n\nI don't have a problem with people voting red or blue or any other party. I have as much problem with our politicians as anyone, but what is weird is that people see Trump as some kind of great savior--He's not. He is as corrupt as they come, and there is plenty of evidence of that. I can provide evidence all day to anyone who is interested--it goes way back before he was ever running for Pres--this guy has always been in on a grift. This dude is not \"one of us\", he is a crook and a con-man and born with a silver spoon and craps on a golden toilet. He has also lost money his whole life--he is not good at business. He is only rich because of his father's corrupt money, but he is actually hundreds of millions in debt--how is someone like that going to get us out of debt? This guy will cheat anyone to get money or status, including citizens of our country. He does not care what kind of harm he does or long terms effects of profiteering. That is my opinion, and why I will not vote for him. I don't watch TV, am not a \"libtard\", I am not brainwashed--I can talk cold hard facts all day and I wish more Americans would do actual research on policy, rather than just having parasocial relationships with politicians as celebrities.", "date": "2024-10-25T16:22:01Z", "like_count": 0}, {"id": "UgwvPqLqVBki4NOKmvt4AaABAg.A7QJ918oxIIAADkXmZ-EqL", "author_id": "UC94g3GMr4eVZR2SDlSXWrlA", "author_name": "@serolog", "content": "President of Ukraine is a comedian", "date": "2024-10-30T15:46:33Z", "like_count": 0}, {"id": "UgwvPqLqVBki4NOKmvt4AaABAg.A7QJ918oxIIAAIvT7r0quI", "author_id": "UC9nChHEEAMuDni2rBC9VOjQ", "author_name": "@dreamoutloud2629", "content": "Awesome comment and sad but true LOL", "date": "2024-11-01T15:58:15Z", "like_count": 1}, {"id": "UgwvPqLqVBki4NOKmvt4AaABAg.A7QJ918oxIIAAIwS-dc_RP", "author_id": "UCHBbTOKrGtk4VOAopv1Eh2A", "author_name": "@JeffNeet", "content": "Me?  ... yes.

Thousands more lost jobs when they resisted mandatory experimental vaccines. All Democrat policy, and well after solid scientific evidence that COVID was not anywhere near as dangerous as was feared.

He has ONE BEER after he works and then is done with more work at whole‚Ä¶. He calls himself an alcoholic. And he is considering the true definition apparently‚Ä¶. When I drink, I have to keep drinking until I loose the inhibition to even continue drinking‚Ä¶.. constantly. \n\nMe AND my father are clinically considered alcoholics by definition. \n\nYou seem oddly in defense of alcohol and the ‚Äúability‚Äù to drink socially and responsibly. I well if I wasn‚Äôt sober and still drinking, I COULD maintain not drinking for days, or limiting the alcohol I bought so I could control my drinking sometimes. Many times and more times than not actually. But then there was always THAT night that eventually happened again and again‚Ä¶\n\nAnd it not about me‚Ä¶. LITERALLY every drop of alcohol is poison to the brain. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve heard something like ‚Äúa glass of wine is good for your heart and blood‚Äù \n\nWhich is true, but any amount of POISON destroys your brain bit by bit‚Ä¶.. don‚Äôt drink much?

At universities there are Tispsy Tuesdays, Whacked out Wednesdays, Thirsty Thursdays, Fucked up Fridays, and then the weekend.

There is a political ad against Vance stating ‚Äúhe wants to curb drinking so he‚Äôs not for Wisconsin‚Äù (paraphrasing of course). We were founded on a group of people who turned American Indians into alcoholics. \nAt the end of the day, the fact that in our country, there are public places called ‚Äúbars‚Äùto take a liquid drug that influences consciousness, and commercials on the most watched TV stations promoting the liquid drug, yet we have a ‚Äúwar on drugs‚Äù spanning half of a century, and truly dating back much further, shows you alcohol is inseparable from this culture. \nAgain, take Wisconsin as an example; we have a Republican senate (I‚Äôm not a repub or dem cuz I‚Äôm not retarded), who is bought out by the Tavern League of Wisconsin. The Tavern League is a massive lobbyist group responsible for not allowing Cannabis to become legal recreationally or medicinally, because they know it will hurt their sales, and no one in Wisconsin bags an eye.

You need to google alcoholism. First off you keep contradicting yourself and second off you're assuming people drinking at social gatherings, are having 5+ drinks. Which personally I don't know many people who have that many at a social gathering, but I know tons of people who do drink a couple. I don't drink, but so many people do.\n\nAlso you're assuming they need the alcohol in your example, which would usually point to alcoholism. Yet most people enjoy social drinking and just want it, but they don't need it. Enjoying alcohol does not prove anything and part of enjoying it is for its effects.\n\nWhat would be signs of alcoholism are withdrawal symptoms, emotional and physical dependence, and it preoccupying large parts of their life. Especially taking over their life when they wouldn't otherwise want it to. Having a few beers at a party is not indicative of anything at all. Even getting plastered doesn't make them an alcoholic. In fact parties are often far and few between, so that's hardly any drinking anyway. Moderation is key and plenty of people can get wasted, without needing to or wanting to do it again when it wears off.\n\nYou're just spreading BS for no reason at all. There is no rationale to what you're trying to say and it sounds extremely immature. It sounds like you don't ever have interactions with real people. Touch some grass. Not everyone is an alcoholic who drinks. Having a few drinks at a social gathering is the norm in the US and doesn't prove alcoholism in the slightest. There's a pretty obvious line that separates people who definitely are and definitely aren't alcoholics. So go read up on it yourself.\n\nActually after reading the rest of your comments you're just a troll.

And the federal debt went from 14 b to 21 b... You talk about most rich people supporting Kamala but meanwhile Trump has countless billionaires rallying behind him hahaha.

He remarks, \"I feel this capital.\" I've had that feeling before, but most of the time, I was more like Doc Holliday, who was a functional alcoholic. However, when I quit drinking, I ended up more like Curly Bill. Curly Bill was drunk enough to still stumble around and walk, and he felt like he had control, but eventually, when you're an alcoholic, the alcohol takes over, overwhelms your motor skills, and that's it‚Äîyou‚Äôre done. That's what accidentally killed Fred.\n\nBut if you notice Doc Holliday at the beginning of the movie, as a functional alcoholic, when Billy says to the drunk piano player, \"You're probably seeing double,\" and Doc replies, \"I have two guns, one for each of you,\" if you zoom in on the guns, you'll notice that Doc had such dexterity, even in a drunken state. You'll see that he rotates both guns in opposite directions. That takes one hell of a lot of dexterity and coordination to be able to do that. But towards the end of my drinking career, shall we say, I ended up more like Curly Bill.

Biden‚Äôs term isn‚Äôt even over, and already he‚Äôs spent $6.8 trillion, but what has he spent it on? Illegal immigrants, foreign wars, DEI, transgenderizing children and prison inmates, and criminal justice reform that makes it easier for criminals to LEGALLY steal, and releases them sooner. We have some states with cashless bail, that way criminals can go commit more crimes while they are waiting to skip out on their arraignment. If you‚Äôre in favor of any of this, then I don‚Äôt know what you are, but you are not an American. Trump broke y‚Äôall‚Äôs brains. You care more about people that hate you and want to victimize you than you do about your own countrymen. The only silver lining I see to Kamala winning is that you all will have to face the consequences of your politics sooner rather than later. Something I‚Äôd love to see, if I didn‚Äôt also have to suffer the consequences of your uninformed decisions. Keep enjoying all the Trump interviews, since your candidate is so afraid of looking stupid she won‚Äôt even open her mouth publicly, preferring to hide in the basement with Biden until Election Day.

Everybody talks about  how ‚ÄúOh he added $7 trillion to the national debt.‚Äù Well, he did that to protect our borders, develop the Covid vaccines, and give American who needed it a stimulus check. Biden‚Äôs term isn‚Äôt even over, and already he‚Äôs spent $6.8 trillion, but what has he spent it on? Illegal immigrants, foreign wars, DEI, transgenderizing children and prison inmates, and criminal justice reform that makes it easier for criminals to LEGALLY steal, and releases them sooner. We have some states with cashless bail, that way criminals can go commit more crimes while they are waiting to skip out on their arraignment. If you‚Äôre in favor of any of this, then I don‚Äôt know what you are, but you are not an American. Trump broke y‚Äôall‚Äôs brains. You care more about people that hate you and want to victimize you than you do about your own countrymen. The only silver lining I see to Kamala winning is that you all will have to face the consequences of your politics sooner rather than later. Something I‚Äôd love to see, if I didn‚Äôt also have to suffer the consequences of your uninformed decisions. Keep enjoying all the Trump interviews, since your candidate is so afraid of looking stupid she won‚Äôt even open her mouth publicly, preferring to hide in the basement with Biden until Election Day.
