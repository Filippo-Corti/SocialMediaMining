You say that you don't think harris is communist yet everything she and most prominent lefties in politics advocate for would lead to full communistic dictatorship.  Like you can't be that naive. Here's there plan since you are oblivious apparently. Step 1 divide the country.  Push lbqt heavily, call trump a dictator and threat to democracy despite it being untrue.  Open the border and flood the US with Venezuelan gang members, cartel and even worst radical Islamic threats.  Take over slowly from state to state with huge protests in the streets ala the pro Palestine crap.  See colorado and now chicago.  Use the media and social media to poison the minds of younger kids and young adults to convince them that there's so much racism and we must be inclusive.  Tears a recipe for all these \"white allies\" marching in these pro Palestine parades as well as \"queens for palestine\".  Yet the Palestine hate the gats by the way.  Make that make sense.  They already instituted free speech being taken away for the past 4 to 6 years.  Facebook,insta,Twitter,Google,YouTube all complicit it censoring right leaning people.  Then they keep pushing for gun control to disarm us so that we habe no way to fight tyranny.  Hence look at UK, France,  Canada, Australia.  Every single one has crazy laws or have had crazy laws forcing vaccines.  Australia is pushing the \"digital id\" which means full government control.  You can't buy food without it, get gas, get healthvare,go do extracurricular activity ls, go to work.  You have people in UK and France arresting citizens for freedom of speech and letting Islamic illegals pray in the cities streets blocking traffic, wield machetes, beat up uk citizens etc.  All of this is slowly creeping into the US day by day all because of policies from the harris administration.  Not to mention we are fighting multiple wars middle east  , Ukraine.  We are an election away from losing America if trump doesn't win. You have to be blind at this point not to see the writing on the wall.  It's clear as day.  But you still are troubled because Donald Trump rightfully so challenged an election that was extremely fishy.  Certain swing state counties stopped counting votes on election night mysteriously when trump was up big.  They resumed the next morning with biden now leaving.  That seems normal to you? All the videos showing people with hundreds of ballots being jammed in the box.  We have evidence of specific routes people were taking to stuff ballot boxes in certain states.  There were instances of poll watchers being denied access to watch them count.  To say the election was fair is Ludacris.  It was tainted and you can't ignore the facts.  By the way if the dems win again they won't need your left wing ideologies anymore to pander too.  Lgbqt will be thrown to the waste.  Pro abortion will be thrown to the side.  They could care less on the environment its just a means to an end.  It will be a one world government with strict precise rules and if you disagree you will be jailed.  Guns are the only thing stopping them.  We have one last chance to stop this.  Majority of these evil people are getting older and father time will catch up to them.  They got nothing to lose.  They want full control and less people in the world.", "date": "2024-09-04T13:26:11Z", "like_count": 0}, {"id": "Ugw__rqpotClpcWLWLp4AaABAg.A7w1t_qBEy7A7yJJXTgx0D", "author_id": "UCeU0NPGZXB6ZgCpWhuV9neg", "author_name": "@victorrmiranda87", "content": "O", "date": "2024-09-04T13:29:18Z", "like_count": 0}, {"id": "Ugw__rqpotClpcWLWLp4AaABAg.A7w1t_qBEy7A7yKNC5FPzr", "author_id": "UC6CneOFoQ8OZED52Q5n9hdQ", "author_name": "@avaforlife4141", "content": "@johnc9931¬† you are beyond help at this point.

He also admitted for at least the second time in a few weeks that \"he lost by a whisker\". Wish he'd been honest about this before Jan 6th. Unfortunately neither of these or other minor admission are what people are going to remember. My main point was that when Lex interviews other people (innovators, influencers, tech bros) he always finds a way to get below the first answer and to get to something deeper. There was none of that in this interview. Perhaps because he knew he only had 45min and he tried to cover too much ground. @VladVexlerChat review of the interview hits the nail on the head. Friedman's style requires that a level of goodwill by the interviewee and willingness to go deeper than you'd get from a mainstream media interview. Trump (and too be fair...most politicians) are going to be guarded and just spew their talking points, so this interview wasn't materially better or different than a Trump Fox or Newsmax interview. That's what's disappointing. Everyone is touting how great it is that Trump did a long form interview.

Knowing that he is blunt by nature I think they almost always try to trigger his negative side and response whereas Lex tried to subtly suggest he did not agree through eye-contact and body language and Trump recognised the tone and answered it in his own way. That's the way I saw the interview- maybe you too have a subliminal predisposition about Trump. Yes though, one might think that, if he was such a calm and collected person why would he be triggered so easily -- by hearing him speak towards the positive aspects, try to read between the lines-- maybe he is trying to be a clean slate (The Fool in front of the mass media) because he already doesn't believe them strongly - calling them fake news and also mentioning here in the podcast the loss of power over the years (which we all know) even the likes of Gary Vee and all always propogate it) Or if you are a regular youtube viewer, you will agree too how high quality these podcasts are compared to reporting media on tv. I don't like the way they frame questions towards Trump, even when Hilary was his opposition (They always went against his views from the get-go) It wouldnt be strange for them to script it in such a way that he would have to back into a corner to answer it like he does.

We are talking about a man who believes his business experience qualifies him to lead the largest economy in the world, yet he left it $8 trillion in debt.  \nYou seem to be glossing over his track record that reveals several significant failures which challenge the narrative of his success. Trump has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy SIX times, largely due to mismanagement of his casinos and real estate ventures. His businesses, including the Trump Taj Mahal, Trump Plaza, and Trump Castle, were unable to generate enough revenue to cover massive debt loads, forcing restructuring. Additionally, his other ventures, such as Trump Airlines, Trump University, and Trump Vodka, were high-profile failures that either lost money or shut down entirely.\nFurthermore, Trump‚Äôs heavy reliance on debt financing often put his businesses at risk, leading to the collapse of multiple enterprises. Much of his wealth came from licensing deals rather than successful management of companies. This pattern reveals a business model prone to risk, failure, and reliance on bankruptcy protections rather than sustained success. He is a charlatan and if elected again he will destroy the foundations of our democracy.

Get to learn more about the candidates.  Also, I think Lex's intention for the podcast is to be a neutral zone for people of both sides to speak on any topic, so since Trump's been on he's going to have to bring Kamala on to keep the podcast neutral.  Otherwise, people are going to see his podcast as being 1-sided and he'll lose around half of his viewership.  It's why I believe he needs to get Putin on because he's already had Zelensky.  What a surprise that was!  On that note, I'd also be interested to see Xi on the podcast at some point as well.  That man is a mystery.  We know what's happening in Russia and can predict what Russia will do tomorrow, but China is a mystery.  I've heard there's political infighting between different factions and I wonder if that's causing some of the problems that China is having because if you have officials fighting with each other, they're obviously going to try to sabotage their rivals which will result in some problems happening in some parts of China.  I lived through the 2-month lockdown in Shanghai which many deemed unnecessary and poorly managed.  Well, the officials running Shanghai are part of an anti-Xi faction, so I wonder if the 2 month lockdown or poor management of distribution of food was the result of the political infighting going on between Shanghai and Beijing.  You're obviously not going to hear that in a podcast, but you can try to pick up indirect hints to what is going on behind the scenes within the government.

He must not have been a spiritual influence with his other children, as his daughter converted to Judaism.  He repeatedly denied the affair, denied knowing anything about payments to Stormy, though it is clear he knew about it and signed off on the checks--then filed false paperwork about it.  It came out during his criminal try that his friend at the Enquirer would suppress stories negative to Trump and would plant false stories about other candidates-- e.g, the false story about \nSenator Cruz's father being involved in the assassination of Kennedy.  He had a false charity and rip-off school that charged tens of thousands to the gullible.  He is a convicted felon and certainly, if the prosecutors do not run out of time before he is possibly reelected, he will be convicted of many more felonies for failing to return classified documents and then trying to have people that work for him cause those documents to disappear.  He had top military secrets in the bathroom of Mar-a-lago.  He lied about not losing the election and encouraged a mob to attack the policy and when Pence's life was threatened, said it was his fault.  Stood by and did nothing as Capital was attacked.   Tried to interfer in FBI investigations and fired Comey when he would not go along with his unlawful conduct.  Disgracefully asked Ukraine for political favor in return for munitions.  Constantly berated the military leadership and claimed to know more than they did even though he was a draft dodger.  Was sickenly subservient to Putin saying he was telling the truth and that our FBI and CIA was lying about election interference.  Failed to keep the main promise he ran on, to build a wall and make Mexico pay for it.  Yes, he kept more illegals out of the country and both parties have been terrible when it comes to illegal immigration.  He inherited a great economy that low inflation, low unemployment, low mortgage rates, a stock market that had been on fire, and he spent more money that any president in history-\nHe was a disgrace and I say this as a lifelong Republican.  I am ashamed that so many of my party could follow this lifelong democrat with no morals and seemingly no brain.", "date": "2024-09-05T00:44:07Z", "like_count": 0}, {"id": "UgzplbMm1dr_xCDBXI14AaABAg.A7wXVa4fHtkA7zXexzFGf0", "author_id": "UCBw781m_Mw-f4HDnByWl8hw", "author_name": "@cactusimon", "content": "@@Lukas-lp2fzRead a book, please", "date": "2024-09-05T00:53:57Z", "like_count": 0}, {"id": "UgzplbMm1dr_xCDBXI14AaABAg.A7wXVa4fHtkA7zYECLhxYZ", "author_id": "UCEB6GtbGbZybqkfD-t1Sp2g", "author_name": "@Light_Lead-b3v", "content": "‚Äã@@losangdonyo4823 If you think that's deep you need to raise your standards", "date": "2024-09-05T00:58:53Z", "like_count": 0}, {"id": "UgzplbMm1dr_xCDBXI14AaABAg.A7wXVa4fHtkA7zYjFfP16N", "author_id": "UCelrk0H7fAbpfgwBjaxTp3w", "author_name": "@ty194", "content": "‚Äã@@lumayne8829That's literally what they're trying to put him in prison for, so how does that work?", "date": "2024-09-05T01:03:16Z", "like_count": 0}, {"id": "UgzplbMm1dr_xCDBXI14AaABAg.A7wXVa4fHtkA7z_2068yY0", "author_id": "UCW_MHuDGqZd7wpfsd9LYWXQ", "author_name": "@MeanBeanComedy", "content": "‚Äã@@Lukas-lp2fz Nah, it's actually a classic.", "date": "2024-09-05T01:14:42Z", "like_count": 0}, {"id": "UgzplbMm1dr_xCDBXI14AaABAg.A7wXVa4fHtkA7z_jNKxVjK", "author_id": "UCENvhvV6T-n-z3mB4u8fnfA", "author_name": "@luwiesgirl", "content": "@@TSSPDarkStar His answer should have been nothing so they could lose their minds.

The net-net is that Trump caused the mess that Biden had to clean up...Why didn't Trump stop withdrawing troops after numerous violations of terms of the agreement by the Taliban??\n\nTHE DEAL. The Trump-Taliban deal was set on Feb 29, 2020 when there were 13,000 US troops in Afghanistan. The deal included the phased release of 5,000 Taliban prisoners.\n\nTALIBAN VIOLATIONS. The Taliban VIOLATED the agreement with attacks in early March and again in early May. On Aug 18, the DOD IG complained that the Taliban continued to violate terms of the agreement. The final release of 5,000 (total) Taliban prisoners was completed on Sep 3, but was quickly followed by Taliban attacks in three provinces, again violating the terms of the agreement. More Taliban attacks were reported by the DOD IG Nov 17 and Dec 2. On Jan 15, 2021, the new VP of Afghanistan complained that the US made too many concessions to the Taliban as US troops were reduced to 2,500 by mid Jan 2021 (10,000+ LESS than a year earlier). With these persistent Taliban violations, why did Trump keep pulling out US troops and release Taliban prisoners? \n\nTRUMP‚ÄôS MESS. Trump was played for a fool by the Taliban. Trump was weak, leaving a mess for Biden. With only 2,500 troops, there was no way for a safe evacuation of all the Afghan advisors and US supporters. To ensure safe passage, Biden would have had to bring back 10s of thousand of US troops back into Afghanistan in early 2021, which would have put many more US troops at risk of being sitting ducks to Taliban rocket propelled grenades along evacuation paths and airports and could have produced many more US deaths and much worse results for Biden politically. Just keeping Bagram open without thousands more troops would have made those soldiers sitting ducks as well. Trump never should have let the Taliban off the hook after the Taliban persistently violated terms of the agreement. Net-net, Trump set up the disaster that Biden had to fix.\n\n\n\nReply", "date": "2024-09-04T03:08:21Z", "like_count": 0}, {"id": "Ugym_A7scNZWciZOVqB4AaABAg.A7wA-q7QgoiA7xEU06DCmn", "author_id": "UCFtmsym1UGyzhI3enTisTzA", "author_name": "@actionjksn", "content": "That's not really how it went.

It's the exact same issues with why Benghazi was such a catastrophe and why the Clinton State Department tried to cover it up, they were warned, did nothing, and then when people died tried to deflect blame. \nThe media turned the Benghazi raid into a talking point about \"her emails\" but it was more than that. The State Department screwed up, tried to cover it up, ad no one was held responsible. The Afghanistan withdrawal is the same. They screwed up. Go watch the testimony of the sniper who was blown up and survived the attack at the gate. They ad intel that there would be a suicide bomber, he had the bomber in his sights the day before and asked permission to engage and he was told no. The next day 13 people died and he was permanently maimed. Not to mention they didn't have an exit strategy for allies, they gave up a military station before they got equipment out, and they overall screwed up the timeline since they didn't want to end the war in the first place. This is why Trump is so mad and calls them incompetent all the time. This is why we are mad about it still. No one was fired and people just move on. Let's not forget in the last presidential debate Biden said, \"No soldiers have died under my watch.\" He forgot about the 13 his administration allowed to die because they couldn't let the war end.

Which it is not \n\nThe things people are fighting for and against are  what divides us not DJT. \n\nIMO - His answer is truthful and direct‚Ä¶ not full of fluff speech.  \n\nPick a side based on the issues they represent and policy they want to put into practice ~ and see which candidate you link up with ~ the division is real‚Ä¶. But not because DJT created it or makes it worse. He is suppose to be transparent in his views and policy he wants to enact. I believe he has done that \n\nHas she? \n\nThere is no uniting people who believe so completely opposite from one another. \n\nSo, is he a divider ~ no, he is clearly unapologetic about what stance he takes. He is an open book with his opinions. \n\nSo, will everyone agree with him 100% of course not \n\nBut if you find your most important things in line with his policy ~ then voting for the other side is foolish in my opinion \n\nI say, let the policy guide you \n\nThe division is not of his making ~ he didn‚Äôt create the issues \n\nTransgender issues, abortion debates, 1st amendment debates, 2nd amendment debates‚Ä¶. Immigration,  tax issues, inflation or social security issues‚Ä¶ military issues \n\nThese issues divide people because of how they think not because of how he responds to an interview \n\nHe is there to give you his stance on issues. He is not there to unite us \n\nGovernment or politicians are not match makers ~ information and education is the answer to change minds \n\nChanging hearts is not a politicians job that is a personal decision \n\nIn my opinion ~ he is there to tell you what he stands for. So is Kamala ~ I don‚Äôt need her to make me feel warm and fuzzy over men who want to go into women‚Äôs bathrooms or try to make me unite with them because they were born here too‚Ä¶. I disagree with them. I want to know her stance not her ability to make me overlook our differences and sing at the campfire. \n\nUniting the country is a ridiculous idea. How is that possible when public discourse is what hammers out into policy, which is the direction the nation follows. \n\nWe are united in the fight to make this nation better through ideas. \n\nI don‚Äôt have to like yours and you don‚Äôt have to like mine. We just have to present them and keep an open mind because maybe we will hear a fact or information that changes our stance on something‚Ä¶ \n\nThat is what unites us \n\nThe fact we disagree and are allowed to do that in a country that embraces the differences \n\nThe ability to disagree in a nation where the republic stands‚Ä¶ one nation - under god, indivisible with liberty and justice for all‚Ä¶. That is the unifier \n\nIf you believe this form of government under the constitution is what you pledge your allegiance to‚Ä¶ that is what unifies us. However if you don‚Äôt think this government or constitution is what you want ~ there is no remedy to that‚Ä¶ also, there is no remedy to two opposing ideas. Opposing ideas will always be divided. That is the nature of opposite views \n\nIf you believe the constitution holds us together then  this nation can not be divided by disagreement or choosing sides \n\nDisagreement and the battle of ideas well, that is what I was taught makes America unique in the world ~ where you can do exactly that ~ with out the government censorship or your neighbors being allowed to shut you down. \n\nWe who disagree with the protestors are united with the protester and the person on this he opposite side because we are able to recognize they have the right to do exactly that‚Ä¶. Isn‚Äôt that beautiful ? That is what unites us ~ that this nation is protecting us from mob rule. That it is a republic where individual rights are protected.  \n\nSo, some issues are extremely divisive and people will never unite over them‚Ä¶ that is perfectly fine too \n\nPick a side and allow the policy to be the guide to what candidate you choose \n\nNot who is going to do the impossible ~ unite people who will never agree‚Ä¶. \n\nLike I said ~ the politician and government isn‚Äôt suppose to do that \n\nYour faith, your personal choice to unite with your neighbor who is not of the same political persuasion or other things that make you different from them is a personal choice ~ that is up to individuals \n\nNot a government ~ or political leader \n\nThey are there to lead a nation based on their policies formed to solve problems, enact change and push the nation to a better place  then it was  \n\nEducation and life lessons of all kinds bring people‚Äôs minds to change ~ \n\nChanging hearts are a choice left to the individual ~ not an elected leader that is there to lead the military, veto legislation based on their political stance or enact legislation based on their political stance they spell out in the debates‚Ä¶. And campaign‚Ä¶ \n\nTo say the president is suppose to unite us  is like saying composer can unite all the music lovers to agree. \n\nNo, uniting with your neighbor and showing respect and love in the face of disagreement is a choice by each individual. It takes the individual to choose to allow the other music in and give it a fair chance‚Ä¶. But even after that they may choose it isn‚Äôt for them‚Ä¶ in the end, I think  what could unite two people who disagree about the music for example - is the respect for the artist who worked to make that piece of music they actually  hate. So respecting things at the core is up to the individual not up to the composer to make you have warm and fuzzy feelings about the artist by they way they are inclusive and embrace all music ~ so you should too‚Ä¶ no, that isn‚Äôt the kind of leadership I want \n\nI don‚Äôt want a cult like leader who controls the masses by being persuading in showing people how to embrace things they stand against. \n\nI want a leader who provokes thought and is transparent ~ so I can differ with them and agree but always use my own mind to decide. \n\nSo my example is you can hate the protest or the person who is standing there waving racial ideas in your face but love the fact we all live in a country that protects their right to do so. \n\nSo, to me what united us and always has is the constitution ~ not any politician who represent opposing views on how to lead this nation for a short time .  \n\nSo, choose the candidate that  most aligns with your stance on issues you deem as important and who is making the policies you most agree with‚Ä¶. \n\nRegardless of their brazen personality, or their cackle for example‚Ä¶ \n\nOr any of the tiny issues people are making the reason they don‚Äôt like a candidate. \n\nThose things are irrelevant to me‚Ä¶ policy and results are. \n\nKamala‚Äôs laugh ??? ~ who cares about her cackle ? If she has the best policy let the ideas be the guide to who gets to run the country and visa versa for Trump.

But be real; Soviet style price controls aren‚Äôt coming. What is happening instead is limits on price gouging during events like the pandemic, and we already do that all across the country in red and blue states alike. There is nuance.\n\nCensorship comes from all sides. Florida for instance just passed a law that bans books from high schools that contain sexuality, without any consideration of the merit of the rest of the contents or context of the book. That‚Äôs pretty draconian if you ask me. The tendency for the party in power to seek to curtail speech is strong in all cases.\n\nAs for your ‚ÄúDEI hires‚Äù comment, there is a lot of nuance there, and frankly you come off badly when you phrase it the way you did. I as a majority citizen think DEI policies have positives and negatives, and so called ‚Äúreverse racism‚Äù is bad for society. But on the other hand, I don‚Äôt see the party as owning that agenda; I see it almost as a populist movement at this point (though it started as an academic/elite concept). And I already see the pendulum swinging in the opposite direction, which is mostly good at this point. Though, issues like these can easily swing too far in the opposite direction.\n\nAs for immigration, I don‚Äôt like that the current administration dragged their feet on it, but they did ultimately take steps in the right direction (which Trump opposed for political gain; something I don‚Äôt respect). On the other hand, the right, and the former president Trump in particular, is far too much of an immigration hawk for my liking. And honestly, insofar as it supports business, I think Trump is in favor of cheap labor. The fact is, we‚Äôve got to have sustained immigration into our country so that we can sustain our population and workforce over the next decades as boomers age out of the workforce and the birth rate declines. We‚Äôve just got to do it better than we‚Äôve been doing it.

She kept people in prison past their release date because, as she told the court who reprimanded her, CA needs free labor to fight forest fires. That might even be a direct quote. She also withheld evidence that would have freed innocent people from death row because the successful convictions would help her acheive higher political office. These are undisputed facts. She's a straight-up jackboot police statist, and even leftist organizations like Black Lives Matter have rightly denounced her for her horrific record on civil rights. Her record is so bad that tons of people on both the left and right deservedly despise her for her terrible civil rights record as a prosecutor. Who's the authoritarian tyrant again?

He also claimed that it would never have started under him (who the knows if that's true). So, Ukraine is debatable to some degree. However, Biden did pull out of Afghanistan and all but ended the drone wars. Indisputably, that is far more \"anti-war\" than Trump. However, one may point out rightfully, Biden has supported Israel in its brutal regional war almost unconditionally. Trump, on this issue, claims that Biden is \"holding Netanyahu back\" and isn't supporting them enough. He has also taken $100 million from the Israeli billionaire Miriam Adelson, who openly wants Israel to annex the West Bank and continue the regional war. On the war in Gaza, which currently has a 70-90% civilian death rate and is considered by essentially all human rights organizations an ethnic cleansing operation, Trump famously said in the debate with Biden that he should allow Israel to \"finish the job\". He also recently said that we should bomb Iran's nuclear facilities.\n\nAll that is to say, Trump's record is very aggressive and hawkish, and he is openly advocating for escalating the war in the middle east.

Have fluids, you will purge from one end or the other. It's nothing bad. And have 5HTP supplement for the next day. Your dopamine's will be low the next day. Just worn out from the experience you just had. Good experience is based on set and setting, cover your eyes. Calming sounds are almost needed just to let you focus on your experience. Many people describe a 'guide' that will be with you and show you things. Not a physical guide but for me a guy showed up. He was like a skinny funny Marine Corps type. I had pen and paper. I documented everything I was told or shown. It sounds weird. It's no weirder than (if you have a right heart) than the lil dreams that can happen just before falling asleep. Afterwards. You will fill like a Million bucks. Hope. Smiles. Joy. The world will eventually grind again but there are maintenance doses that are even safe for work. Just lightens the mood and no psychedelic effects. It literally bypasses the brains normal routes. All roads are close. Your brain tells the electronics of your brain \"find another route\" so that route may show you memories you had buried, lost, or forgotten.

It can be helpful. If they first experience cleans out the closet, don't give up. Try it again. I had to learn all of this to live. I've been studying The Brain for 5 yrs now. It makes perfect sense the effects of psychedelics. A really amazing thing is Mycelium. That grows the mushrooms as a fruit but watch some videos of Mycelium. It will blow you away how brilliant, operational, intentional, and thought processing Mycelium is. It has many jobs but the most impressive to me is that it will intelligently look for trees that need carbons from the earth and will negotiate with a tree that is in distress. Give me your sugar and I'll give you my healing carbons. It's crazy amazing. You can watch the process microscopically. It is an impressive thing. I took the time to do my best because I recognize the plea, and I have studied the processes. There needs to be a place for this information to all be linked together. I truly believe foreign deployed vets have deoxyribonucleic acid damage, I truly believe some tech damages a certain protein within our DNA Helix, which effects the Amygdala health. And I truly believe there are answers to be found also in Pineal Gland. I didn't like watching the VA just label and prescribe. That is laziness. They don't care.

They cause permanent changes in the brain. For you this was positive. For me I have HPPD. I actually have the most extreme case of HPPD in the western world. As someone that's never had a bad trip (I'm naturally positive about myself) this doesn't bother me but if someone else was in my situation they would be overwhelmed. I quit doing psychedilics and drinking alcohol when my kid was born (months before actually.) I still am tripping though and see thick digital static/snow and will for the rest of my life. There is no cure to hppd (1 woman claimed to be cured by lamictal, I don't believe her and the side effects and permanent neurological damage caused by antipsychotics will never be worth trying them,) so when you have hppd you have it. I thought at one point in time it would be cool to trip forever then I grew up some more and had responsibility and goals in life and all that, and I can say it did me little good. Sure it was an interesting experience but I don't think it would be for everyone and for every one that is \"cured\" of their ptsd there will be someone with hppd. Hppd for many people can become crippling or even disabling if they can't overcome their anxiety and many don't. Many become agoraphobes and can't function without benzodiazepines (which I am also about to begin treatment with through a doctor but don't intend to take daily due to their side effects,) and it's a bad deal. Some people like my lil bro literally never felt depression or anxiety until the first time they tripped (and their first trip was a bad trip,) and then they have never not felt vulnerable to depression after. Psychedelic therapy will require some serious precautions and also all kinds of screening. One of my friends who tripped with me had his schizophrenia triggered. After tripping ONCE.

He took measures to try and contain it by closing down flights and was called a racist and chastised by the media and the left.

Trump increased the production of ventilators and masks, and other equipment that they determined would be necessary, even sending them to other countries who needed them. The only people that knew that this would escalate are the ones that created it, which wasn‚Äôt Trump. Trump locked us down for a few weeks and probably lowered the cases. It never amounted to what they were planning. The emergency tent and the Navy medical vessel Trump brought into New York was never needed. Many of those deaths were from Governor Cuomo locking down the elderly and causing them to die. So, if you think Trump is responsible for the 350,831 cases in 2020, then Biden is responsible for the rest, which is 111,501,251 (statistics from the CDC). Also, if you took any notice, there were 20,100 less deaths that year from the flu, because they made the hospitals report every death as a Covid death, whether or not it was. We only knew one child that died that year. He had a fast moving case of leukemia and sadly died from it. But, the hospital marked his death certificate as being from Covid. The parents tried to have it changed but the bastards wouldn‚Äôt. They were getting paid by the death, so of course they wouldn‚Äôt. I heard and read of this happening a lot. We can also blame Biden for the deaths coming from the jab that he literally forced everyone to get. People are still dying from it, and they are still trying to force it. Biden and Fauci are the ones culpable for these deaths and for the pandemic. In reality, not your hateful, ridiculous opinion. Trump did the best he could with the knowledge he had.

So if the left is afraid of tyranny and preserving democracy, why are they hand picking their nominee without a single vote cast? How is that democracy? Or do they just not care if it pertains to their side? How about arresting the other parties presidential nominee? Is that tyranny? James Comey admitted Hilary broke the law, yet Trump didn‚Äôt have the DOJ arrest her. Does the left have any ethical standards for anything or is it always projection? They‚Äôll spend years saying Trumps strong boarder policy is racist and harmful and then flip their narrative and say he was weak on the boarder and the dems have been strong. They will say Trumps rhetoric is dangerous out of one side of their mouth while calling him the next Hitler and he is trying to destroy democracy. They know nothing of the details surrounding January 6th. The only reality they know is that which is told to them. They are a hive mind. Win or lose, the last ~10 years has proven that democracy is an illusion and that tens of millions of people will believe literally anything that is told to them so long as they think others in their peer group think the same. If anyone with a brain wants to objectively see how corrupt everything is then just realize that the entire Biden administration and media at large hid his declining mental state for years, lying directly to YOUR face, and chastised anyone who asked questions about it.

Specifically, Asperger's. I know from a friend of mine: her face gets literally locked up because the raging emotional storm inside her overwhelms her - it is \"too much to express with mere words and gestures\". Aspies (if I may say so) are literally the most profoundly emotional (and sharp-witted) people in the world, but since they are pretty much normal human beings otherwise, they constantly struggle to express this wealth of emotions and thoughts in a way that is comprehensible to the \"mainstream normies\", and are thus commonly misunderstood as \"cold\" and \"unemotional\" while they are quite the opposite. I always enjoy talking with this sort of people. They suck at lying and cheating, and their bluntness is very refreshing. In a very profound and honest way, not at all like Trump's tedious and constant insults, lies and tantrums. An aspie's word is a word you can trust, because they TOTALLY MEAN IT. They say it straight from the heart, as they see it. Even if I don't agree with their opinion, I do appreciate their inability to sugarcoat things to gain your favor.\n\nNormies ought to treat such people not as \"mentally ill\". They are simply \"normal cranked up to 11\". Back in the Renaissance, they were celebrated as genial, and every self-respecting king wanted them as advisors and artists, because they were, in a way, more deeply human than the average human. Consider Mozart, or Leonardo da Vinci - these were, as it is said, \"totally on the spectrum\", and thus we remember them for a kind of Greatness that is not achievable by \"normies\".", "date": "2024-09-04T16:00:26Z", "like_count": 2}, {"id": "UgxSYTccN3RiwtxG8Vl4AaABAg.A7wSXfupMW1A7yluqPFazQ", "author_id": "UC57Lo7okwpTgcOxJFwU9OnQ", "author_name": "@RC-hv1yx", "content": "@harrydavey9884 Why, because he‚Äôs stoic?

Everything was scripted, and prior to that citizens would never even see or hear the voice of politicians and voted blindly, are you saying you prefer that system? Also the way things were set up in the past, they were more localized, you'd vote for someone local to represent you in the house of Representatives, and the population was much lower then so a lot of people would have met their representatives, or been to town halls with them, or have known them personally, nobody voted for president or senators. Senators were elected by state representatives who were even more local and voted in by the citizens and the citizens would vote for a more local electorate for the electoral college who would then go and investigate higher realms of politics and decide who to vote for for president. The idea that citizens would vote for a president would have been seen as stupid, especially before TV and internet. Newspapers in the early days were also much more biased because there was no way anyone could fact check them quickly. And often 1 newspaper would dominate an area, so all the citizens in that area would get the news the press businesses wanted them to get. And sometimes they'd just make shit up.

Trump is the only one trying to back out of the debate. Harris did a live tv interview with cnn and is saying she will do more. She also has done several on stage Q&As as well as public appearances outside of rallies. She also takes questions from journalists at the white house when she has the opportunity and has corresponded with some foreign leaders. You guys keep trying to bring this up like it's a \"gotcha!\" but it's really not. She already did one like last week and she is gonna do more, because her fans keep asking for it. She is still the vice president meaning she still has to return to DC from time to time to do her job with the senate votes and with the cabinet. So she is working on the hardest jobs in the world while campaigning full time and doing interviews and stuff. After she does more podcasts or whatever you guys will move the goal post by saying \"well Trump did MORE podcasts,\" as if podcasts win elections or as if it's a competition of who can do more podcasts. I think the reason trump is actually doing these is that he hasn't been able to pull a crowd size irl like he used to and can't pull one like Kamala outside of a state like Texas and West Virginia. he couldn't even get a good crowd in the red state of Montana a few weeks ago, stadium was mostly empty. The governor/senator there he was trying to help win by doing a stop there didn't even turn up at the place, because Montana is only a light red state and outside of deep, dark red states you can't win voters by being a sycophant to Trump. It's why they keep losing elections in Wisconsin and Michigan and Rhode Island and Jersey and Oregon and Washington and Colorado and anywhere where the voting base is around 50/50 republicans and democrats, because reasonable republicans move away from trumpism and dems that could vote either way run away from Trump. Honestly, I can't wait for this election to be over.  After Trump loses all his court cases will resume and he is gonna catch conviction after conviction for his crimes and you guys will be out here saying \"I never really liked trump all that much,\" when you're trying to win in 2028 cause you'll have realized the right wing can't win on Trumpism.", "date": "2024-09-05T03:52:55Z", "like_count": 0}, {"id": "UgzRHMHh9FAMI8b9Ysl4AaABAg.A7wBAAYs8iSA7zy30hTH22", "author_id": "UCQaWv1N-T8rfZlG_s8i0QxQ", "author_name": "@rzadigi", "content": "The only people watching this are those who love every word trump says.\nExcept when he said ‚ÄòI love the poorly educated!‚Äô Or when he called his followers schmucks and fools. \nThose things you will surely deny üòÇüòÇ", "date": "2024-09-05T04:53:18Z", "like_count": 0}, {"id": "UgzRHMHh9FAMI8b9Ysl4AaABAg.A7wBAAYs8iSA7zz92wztMB", "author_id": "UCPE92pWaUYI7e7fJHwgJMNg", "author_name": "@cloudsmith7803", "content": "There's a reason they hid Biden from interviews, skipped the primaries to rush Kamala on the ticket.\nVote for our personally picked candidate in this short window, just do it, we told you to do so!", "date": "2024-09-05T05:02:51Z", "like_count": 0}, {"id": "UgzRHMHh9FAMI8b9Ysl4AaABAg.A7wBAAYs8iSA8-3OwZNbsM", "author_id": "UCQaWv1N-T8rfZlG_s8i0QxQ", "author_name": "@rzadigi", "content": "@@cloudsmith7803 why would you even care considering Trump has broke every rule in the book.?", "date": "2024-09-05T05:48:43Z", "like_count": 0}, {"id": "UgzRHMHh9FAMI8b9Ysl4AaABAg.A7wBAAYs8iSA8-5E0xh5Ul", "author_id": "UCO5pxFxnAHhfay4G6kB_bRg", "author_name": "@unraufarms3341", "content": "Would be interested to see kamala get on here and do this with no script and see what she has to say", "date": "2024-09-05T06:04:42Z", "like_count": 0}, {"id": "UgzRHMHh9FAMI8b9Ysl4AaABAg.A7wBAAYs8iSA8-5Jo52Thp", "author_id": "UCO5pxFxnAHhfay4G6kB_bRg", "author_name": "@unraufarms3341", "content": "‚Äã@awesomebeast7509 it humanizes them üíØ they need to have all candidates show their true selfs", "date": "2024-09-05T06:05:29Z", "like_count": 0}, {"id": "UgzRHMHh9FAMI8b9Ysl4AaABAg.A7wBAAYs8iSA8-dfmIvJrO", "author_id": "UC91vv5e1uNIyCHQ8Wh1rdtQ", "author_name": "@JohnnySalami6", "content": "Yes", "date": "2024-09-05T11:14:28Z", "like_count": 0}, {"id": "UgzRHMHh9FAMI8b9Ysl4AaABAg.A7wBAAYs8iSA81g0niUrIM", "author_id": "UCtQrIZbe6RPSHp436d-zVfw", "author_name": "@Tyler_W", "content": "There were supposed to he three, but Harris refused to do the debate scheduled for today on Fox News because she would only go on a friendly network, and she's still haggling over rules and conditions a week out from the ABC debate.

The client list is unknown, but we do have the flight logs. To my memory, the two rubbed elbows a few times at a few big parties for rich NY and FL socialites/philanthropist in the late 90s, early 00s (where the well circulated pictures of them were taken), and he dud take a flight or two on his jet, but he never went to the island or any of his private residences. They basically carpooled from FL to NY since they both had residences there. Sounds as though they were casual aquaintences, though Epstein would often try to play matchmaker with people he was trying to shmooze, and he may have been directly or indirectly involved in setting Trump up to meet Melania at one of the rich guy networking parties they both attended, but that's about as familiar as they got as far as anyone knows. He actually turned against Epstein years before the guy even came under investigation in FL the first time in the late 00s. I think he even straight up said that Epstein's a weird guy \"who likes them young\" and that he and friends like Bill Clinton (who Trump mentioned by name) could get into trouble with the law over some of what he heard was happening at his island (which he also named). He said this in the mid-00s. Not exactly something he'd be saying in public if he was complicit. That's a good way to get burned if Epstein had blackmailed him (which he reportedly did to everybody once he got them to agree to do sus things with girls who shouldn't have been there). The story has it that the moment Trump changed his mind about Epstein was somewhere between 2003-05 when he kicked out and permanently banned Epstein from Mar-a-Lago for hitting on and potentially soliciting the daughter of another patron of his club. Something a lot of people don't know is that kne of Trump's big personal agendas during his first term was making sure that federal law enforcement was cracking down on human trafficking rings. I think he even ordered the creation of a federal taskforce speicfically dedicated to it. There were actually quite a few huge operations that often led to a bunch of arrests and even more kids and young women rescued in those years, even in the heat of 2020 with the pandemic. In fact, arrest and rescue numbers increased during his presidency. Most people just don't know about this stuff because the corporate establishment media did just about everything they could to not talk about it (along with anything else good that he did in office).", "date": "2024-09-06T07:14:04Z", "like_count": 0}, {"id": "Ugw8bEVp91xaGEpndoV4AaABAg.A7wVSWZszLxA81pG4MhW27", "author_id": "UCtQrIZbe6RPSHp436d-zVfw", "author_name": "@Tyler_W", "content": "‚Äãno he didn't. He kicked him out and banned him from Mar-a-Lago for hitting on and possibly soliciting the daughter of another patron. This was well before Epstein was under investigation the first time about 15 years ago. He even straight up said publicly (you might be able to still find the video) that he believes that Epstein liked them a little too young and that he and friends like Bill Clinton might get into trouble if the stories he heard about the private island were true. Again, Trump said this before Epstein was even being investigated. That isn't the sort of thing anyone would say about someone who had blackmail on them, and Epstein had blackmail on everybody he convinced to do sus things with girls because it looks and sounds like he was an intelligence asset of the US and Israel (maybe the UK too) who was running a honeypot operation to control powerful, successful, and influential people. Story has it, though, that Trump was the only high profile wealthy person in FL that investigators contacted who actually tried to help their case with anything he may have known. Trump's type is exotic alpha women with worldly experience, not naive and vulnerable girls who are young enough to be his grandchildren or younger, and everything tbat has come out about the limited connections he did have with Epstein appear to support this.

As we‚Äôve seen with these ‚Äúinterviews‚Äù, Trump is really only using them as a way to push his campaign narrative. Ex: Lex asked a direct question about Jan. 6 and Trump basically just said we should be able to question the validity of elections. Which is true. However, that wasn‚Äôt the intent behind Lex‚Äôs question. I think trump knew that and evaded. I‚Äôm not sure Joe would‚Äôve let that slide.\n\nTrump is using these interviews to further his campaign and reach a wider audience. I don‚Äôt think Joe is interested in doing that.", "date": "2024-09-04T18:47:33Z", "like_count": 0}, {"id": "Ugz6RwryHNpSthicsyJ4AaABAg.A7xcKmBmpfXA7ytaL7yPcT", "author_id": "UCUlCAGarlreZ9qBjFohn1KQ", "author_name": "@didgejamman", "content": "@@memberHD With Shane Gillis in character as Trump.

They want to build their brand, advertise their podcast, mention tour dates, sell books, win elections etc. Joe's had Bernie, Yang, Tulsi, Johnson, RFK all on as candidates. From what I understand the problem has been basically Trump or his people didn't want to do the podcast like normal, so no possible 3 hour sit-down in his studio but rather a 1 hour sit down at Mar A Lago or something, which is far more formal and ends up changing the format and turns Joe into Anderson Cooper.\n It all comes down to can Trump simply go to Joe's studio and sit there for 2+ hours. His schedule has to be so controlled for his safety, especially when POTUS, but maybe things are different now. I think all the podcasts he's done so far have been either at Mar A Lago or some sort of neutral location, so Joe ain't stepping out of his comfort zone. And as a celeb it's obviously going to stir the pot for him and his family. Lots of lunatics will hate and harass his family just for speaking to Trump. I don't think it would hurt his audience at all at this point but it would still get some loudmouths in an uproar and there would be MSM clips for weeks. \n\nAnyway, I'm pretty sure that eventually he has him on. Theo and Lex had him on, Dana loves the guy..and people accuse him nonstop of being weak for not having Trump on and that bothers him.\n\nTrump will talk to anybody, even if he's warned not to...and it seems especially if he's challenged to. Maybe he won't let Trump evade questions but this is Trump we're talking about. He's a master at taking the reins of a conversation and eating up time. The only way I could see it going bad for Trump and also Joe is if Joe had an agenda, and he doesn't. I'm certain he'd outline a bunch of topics he'd like to get into and things he'd like clarified but I'm not sure he'd be hunting for admissions and gotcha soundbites like today's journalists do.", "date": "2024-09-04T21:44:57Z", "like_count": 0}, {"id": "Ugz6RwryHNpSthicsyJ4AaABAg.A7xcKmBmpfXA7zRWJvd4pk", "author_id": "UCUlCAGarlreZ9qBjFohn1KQ", "author_name": "@didgejamman", "content": "@@wheelmanstan I appreciate the well thought out response and agree with almost everything you said. Obviously, you‚Äôre an avid listener to JRE. You are correct, almost everyone who goes on there nowadays has something they want to promote. It didn‚Äôt use to be that way as much. But, as the podcast grew and he got more prominent guest, it became more typical. He still does fight companion and protect our parks, which is mostly just talking about mma or the guys just shootin‚Äô the shit.\n\nI‚Äôm sure he‚Äôs thought about backlash he would get. He‚Äôs had so much before though, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs as much of a concern. From what I‚Äôve gathered watching over the years. I think he doesn‚Äôt want to get involved in the middle of an ongoing election campaign. Or, if he did, he would feel the need to have both candidates on, most likely separately. To try and be objective to both parties. I don‚Äôt think he would have an agenda, but I do think he‚Äôd get frustrated with the bullshit.\n\nBut, what the fuck do I know.

I also want to mention that aliens clearly didn't disclose themselves, and with their technology that uses quantum mechanics it would be easy to manipulate quantum probability choosing our future to delay disclosures, and they had been delayed for many years now, with \"coincidences\" piling up extraterrestrial being replaced by non-human intelligence, UFO by UAP, classification of videos, not listening to close encounter reports, seek to remove funding to find hidden programs, and garbage unclassified video being presented, what I see is an anti-disclosure hidden by \"coincidences\" too frequent, and venting the frustration by claiming it's a disclosure in progress, but it seems to be the opposite.  Governments should be shooting at these objects because the extraterrestrials who travel to Earth are those who enjoy observing human suffering, and struggles, and what type of creature that craves that doesn't cause it also, a strong deterrent is needed, they clearly have technology to become intangible space rocks don't harm them, and no sonic booms, so that show of hate is effective, and its only reasonable to defend people from these creatures so that extra-terrestrials don't cause chaos carelessly because countless people who had close encounters had their lives ruined and it was caused by those hostile extra-terrestrials.", "date": "2024-10-24T21:59:04Z", "like_count": 2}, "replies": []}

Lifelong registered Independent. In fact, its a mindset for me. I swing according to my own universal gavel, noone elses. But I must say, and I havent watched u in a while Lex, partly because of what I have viewed as an unnatural, or as engaging in inauthentic swings, to the far right of some podcasters in ur genre. But this interview of trump, is singularly the best interview I have seen yet of him. I do think that u softballed him, to a certain extent, but I recognize why it was necessary. I would imagine there are few individuals who can truly bring him to a more pure equilibrium, where he actually steps down from his facade for a moment, and into a more authentic light. U did it. And some softballing was necessary, in order to accomplish that. I get it. This inner stoic, u channel, is quite the gift. I cant decide if he metered his responses, and his tendency to paranoia of being scrutinized in a negative light, because he wanted  access to ur audience, or its just ur nature, ur rhythm with the universe, that is devoid of gavels and instead seeks to be a prism of pure and beautiful curiousity in its unwavering light. Im leaning towards the latter. When u mentioned that its the details that matter, I thought of Luce Iraguay in her book, a Democracy Between Two. She said \"true equality,\" is achieved when we finally \"learn to respect the particularities of the other.\" It was required reading in an anthropology class years ago. All of civilization, in my opinion would benefit from that mastery. On ur defense at the end, of social media platforms, I agree with u, but I am troubled by the degree of hate, which often manifests towards the \"other.\" I think some sort of compromise must be met, by the dualing polarities of society, however natural they may be. It moves to upset what needs to be more of an equilibrium, if we are to survive this transition into this new age. I think, or I hope we come to some sort of comprome on the shared requirements, at least to a degree of basic ethics, as a global society, with what nearly feels like instantaneous connection. But I dont know. We're all just in the beginning of this quest. Anyway, beautiful interview.  I'm returning my attention to ur channel. And I hope Kamala, entreaties u to an interview.", "date": "2024-10-23T13:52:33Z", "like_count": 2}, "replies": []}

Lifelong registered Independent. In fact, its a mindset for me. I swing according to my own universal gavel, noone elses. But I must say, and I havent watched u in a while Lex, partly because of what I have viewed as an unnatural, or as engaging in inauthentic swings, to the far right of some podcasters in ur genre. But this interview of trump, is singularly the best interview I have seen yet of him. I do think that u softballed him, to a certain extent, but I recognize why it was necessary. I would imagine there are few individuals who can truly bring him to a more pure equilibrium, where he actually steps down from his facade for a moment, and into a more authentic light. U did it. And some softballing was necessary, in order to accomplish that. I get it. This inner stoic, u channel, is quite the gift. I cant decide if he metered his responses, and his tendency to paranoia of being scrutinized in a negative light, because he wanted  access to ur audience, or its just ur nature, ur rhythm with the universe, that is devoid of gavels and instead seeks to be a prism of pure and beautiful curiousity in its unwavering light. Im leaning towards the latter. When u mentioned that its the details that matter, I thought of Luce Iraguay in her book, a Democracy Between Two. She said \"true equality,\" is achieved when we finally \"learn to respect the particularities of the other.\" It was required reading in an anthropology class years ago. All of civilization, in my opinion would benefit from that mastery. On ur defense at the end, of social media platforms, I agree with u, but I am troubled by the degree of hate, which often manifests towards the \"other.\" I think some sort of compromise must be met, by the dualing polarities of society, however natural they may be. It moves to upset what needs to be more of an equilibrium, if we are to survive this transition into this new age. I think, or I hope we come to some sort of comprome on the shared requirements, at least to a degree of basic ethics, as a global society, with what nearly feels like instantaneous connection. But I dont know. We're all just in the beginning of this quest. Anyway, beautiful interview.  I'm returning my attention to ur channel. And I hope Kamala, entreaties u to an interview.", "date": "2024-10-23T13:52:33Z", "like_count": 2}, "replies": []}
