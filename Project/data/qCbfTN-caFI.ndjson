If so, you said you don't believe Harris when she says she will implement communist price controls. Therefore, you believe she is lying.

It's a bit of a stalemate. We're damned if she does and damned if she don't. We lose either way, don't we?  Unless we dont give her the chance to play.

That is why he aimed to get inflation down to that sweet spot of 1.4%, and achieved it.¬†\nSo, instead of wasting his time talking about psychadelics, you should have been asking him about economics and his achievements in that area, as they pertain to our country. I was also disappointed that you did what every other left wing media personality does, which is to ask him to make peace, peace with the people who have been maliciously accusing, prosecuting, fining, sentencing and yes, even, most likely arranging to have him shot.

You say that you don't think harris is communist yet everything she and most prominent lefties in politics advocate for would lead to full communistic dictatorship.  Like you can't be that naive. Here's there plan since you are oblivious apparently. Step 1 divide the country.  Push lbqt heavily, call trump a dictator and threat to democracy despite it being untrue.  Open the border and flood the US with Venezuelan gang members, cartel and even worst radical Islamic threats.  Take over slowly from state to state with huge protests in the streets ala the pro Palestine crap.  See colorado and now chicago.  Use the media and social media to poison the minds of younger kids and young adults to convince them that there's so much racism and we must be inclusive.  Tears a recipe for all these \"white allies\" marching in these pro Palestine parades as well as \"queens for palestine\".  Yet the Palestine hate the gats by the way.  Make that make sense.  They already instituted free speech being taken away for the past 4 to 6 years.  Facebook,insta,Twitter,Google,YouTube all complicit it censoring right leaning people.  Then they keep pushing for gun control to disarm us so that we habe no way to fight tyranny.  Hence look at UK, France,  Canada, Australia.  Every single one has crazy laws or have had crazy laws forcing vaccines.  Australia is pushing the \"digital id\" which means full government control.  You can't buy food without it, get gas, get healthvare,go do extracurricular activity ls, go to work.  You have people in UK and France arresting citizens for freedom of speech and letting Islamic illegals pray in the cities streets blocking traffic, wield machetes, beat up uk citizens etc.  All of this is slowly creeping into the US day by day all because of policies from the harris administration.  Not to mention we are fighting multiple wars middle east  , Ukraine.  We are an election away from losing America if trump doesn't win. You have to be blind at this point not to see the writing on the wall.  It's clear as day.  But you still are troubled because Donald Trump rightfully so challenged an election that was extremely fishy.  Certain swing state counties stopped counting votes on election night mysteriously when trump was up big.  They resumed the next morning with biden now leaving.  That seems normal to you? All the videos showing people with hundreds of ballots being jammed in the box.  We have evidence of specific routes people were taking to stuff ballot boxes in certain states.  There were instances of poll watchers being denied access to watch them count.  To say the election was fair is Ludacris.  It was tainted and you can't ignore the facts.  By the way if the dems win again they won't need your left wing ideologies anymore to pander too.  Lgbqt will be thrown to the waste.  Pro abortion will be thrown to the side.  They could care less on the environment its just a means to an end.  It will be a one world government with strict precise rules and if you disagree you will be jailed.  Guns are the only thing stopping them.  We have one last chance to stop this.  Majority of these evil people are getting older and father time will catch up to them.  They got nothing to lose.

Unfortunately neither of these or other minor admission are what people are going to remember. My main point was that when Lex interviews other people (innovators, influencers, tech bros) he always finds a way to get below the first answer and to get to something deeper. There was none of that in this interview. Perhaps because he knew he only had 45min and he tried to cover too much ground. @VladVexlerChat review of the interview hits the nail on the head. Friedman's style requires that a level of goodwill by the interviewee and willingness to go deeper than you'd get from a mainstream media interview. Trump (and too be fair...most politicians) are going to be guarded and just spew their talking points, so this interview wasn't materially better or different than a Trump Fox or Newsmax interview.

Knowing that he is blunt by nature I think they almost always try to trigger his negative side and response whereas Lex tried to subtly suggest he did not agree through eye-contact and body language and Trump recognised the tone and answered it in his own way. That's the way I saw the interview- maybe you too have a subliminal predisposition about Trump. Yes though, one might think that, if he was such a calm and collected person why would he be triggered so easily -- by hearing him speak towards the positive aspects, try to read between the lines-- maybe he is trying to be a clean slate (The Fool in front of the mass media) because he already doesn't believe them strongly - calling them fake news and also mentioning here in the podcast the loss of power over the years (which we all know) even the likes of Gary Vee and all always propogate it) Or if you are a regular youtube viewer, you will agree too how high quality these podcasts are compared to reporting media on tv. I don't like the way they frame questions towards Trump, even when Hilary was his opposition (They always went against his views from the get-go) It wouldnt be strange for them to script it in such a way that he would have to back into a corner to answer it like he does.

You say that you don't think harris is communist yet everything she and most prominent lefties in politics advocate for would lead to full communistic dictatorship.  Like you can't be that naive. Here's there plan since you are oblivious apparently. Step 1 divide the country.  Push lbqt heavily, call trump a dictator and threat to democracy despite it being untrue.  Open the border and flood the US with Venezuelan gang members, cartel and even worst radical Islamic threats.  Take over slowly from state to state with huge protests in the streets ala the pro Palestine crap.  See colorado and now chicago.  Use the media and social media to poison the minds of younger kids and young adults to convince them that there's so much racism and we must be inclusive.  Tears a recipe for all these \"white allies\" marching in these pro Palestine parades as well as \"queens for palestine\".  Yet the Palestine hate the gats by the way.  Make that make sense.  They already instituted free speech being taken away for the past 4 to 6 years.  Facebook,insta,Twitter,Google,YouTube all complicit it censoring right leaning people.  Then they keep pushing for gun control to disarm us so that we habe no way to fight tyranny.  Hence look at UK, France,  Canada, Australia.  Every single one has crazy laws or have had crazy laws forcing vaccines.  Australia is pushing the \"digital id\" which means full government control.  You can't buy food without it, get gas, get healthvare,go do extracurricular activity ls, go to work.  You have people in UK and France arresting citizens for freedom of speech and letting Islamic illegals pray in the cities streets blocking traffic, wield machetes, beat up uk citizens etc.  All of this is slowly creeping into the US day by day all because of policies from the harris administration.  Not to mention we are fighting multiple wars middle east  , Ukraine.  We are an election away from losing America if trump doesn't win. You have to be blind at this point not to see the writing on the wall.  It's clear as day.  But you still are troubled because Donald Trump rightfully so challenged an election that was extremely fishy.  Certain swing state counties stopped counting votes on election night mysteriously when trump was up big.  They resumed the next morning with biden now leaving.  That seems normal to you? All the videos showing people with hundreds of ballots being jammed in the box.  We have evidence of specific routes people were taking to stuff ballot boxes in certain states.  There were instances of poll watchers being denied access to watch them count.  To say the election was fair is Ludacris.  It was tainted and you can't ignore the facts.  By the way if the dems win again they won't need your left wing ideologies anymore to pander too.  Lgbqt will be thrown to the waste.  Pro abortion will be thrown to the side.  They could care less on the environment its just a means to an end.  It will be a one world government with strict precise rules and if you disagree you will be jailed.  Guns are the only thing stopping them.  We have one last chance to stop this.  Majority of these evil people are getting older and father time will catch up to them.  They got nothing to lose.

Friedman's style requires that a level of goodwill by the interviewee and willingness to go deeper than you'd get from a mainstream media interview.

Knowing that he is blunt by nature I think they almost always try to trigger his negative side and response whereas Lex tried to subtly suggest he did not agree through eye-contact and body language and Trump recognised the tone and answered it in his own way. That's the way I saw the interview- maybe you too have a subliminal predisposition about Trump. Yes though, one might think that, if he was such a calm and collected person why would he be triggered so easily -- by hearing him speak towards the positive aspects, try to read between the lines-- maybe he is trying to be a clean slate (The Fool in front of the mass media) because he already doesn't believe them strongly - calling them fake news and also mentioning here in the podcast the loss of power over the years (which we all know) even the likes of Gary Vee and all always propogate it) Or if you are a regular youtube viewer, you will agree too how high quality these podcasts are compared to reporting media on tv. I don't like the way they frame questions towards Trump, even when Hilary was his opposition (They always went against his views from the get-go) It wouldnt be strange for them to script it in such a way that he would have to back into a corner to answer it like he does.

Trump has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy SIX times, largely due to mismanagement of his casinos and real estate ventures. His businesses, including the Trump Taj Mahal, Trump Plaza, and Trump Castle, were unable to generate enough revenue to cover massive debt loads, forcing restructuring. Additionally, his other ventures, such as Trump Airlines, Trump University, and Trump Vodka, were high-profile failures that either lost money or shut down entirely.\nFurthermore, Trump‚Äôs heavy reliance on debt financing often put his businesses at risk, leading to the collapse of multiple enterprises. Much of his wealth came from licensing deals rather than successful management of companies. This pattern reveals a business model prone to risk, failure, and reliance on bankruptcy protections rather than sustained success.
