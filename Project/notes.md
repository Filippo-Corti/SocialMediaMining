### Useful video ids:

##### HARRIS

##### TRUMP
qCbfTN-caFI (Lex Friedman)

### TODO:
* Add an SQLite Database to store the comments. It could maybe be just one comment table with a parent_id and video_id attribute.
* Mine data from the 2 videos above
* Extract the set of commentators from both videos and check how many commented under both (I am hoping between 200 and 1000)
